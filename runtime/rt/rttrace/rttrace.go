// Package rttrace records the trace events of an rt task tree. It holds the
// bounded in-memory Recorder, which tests read directly, and the JSON Lines
// writer that emitted main uses when the program is asked to record a run.
// A program that never records links none of it: package rt holds only the
// event type, the Tracer interface and the emission points.
//
// The recorder keeps arrival order (Record.Seq), which is not a happens-before
// order of the run. Two events are ordered only when the runtime orders them:
// events of one goroutine, a task's start before its events, a child's
// body-exit before its owner's observation of it. A law checker reads the
// partial order (docs/research/lawful-runtime-contract.md), never Seq alone.
// The runtime's occurrence ID (rt.Event.ID) is a linear extension of that
// order over the emission points: an event that happens before another has
// the smaller ID. The links between events (rt.Event.Link) are recorded by
// the runtime, so a reader follows them instead of inferring causes.
//
// The recorder keeps each rt.Event whole, including the error and panic
// values it carries; DefaultCapacity bounds the number of slots, not the
// bytes those values retain. Only the writer drops values: it serializes
// failures and defects by type name.
