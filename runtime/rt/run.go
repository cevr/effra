package rt

// settle is the one finalization step shared by every task boundary (Run, so
// child tasks and the root alike) and every scope end, empty or not. It
// records a recovered panic, then applies stop-wins (runtime.md, Exit causes
// rule 5): when t can observe a stop, interruption joins the exit and beats a
// body's success. A stop that arrives during a release is observed here, after
// the release mask closes.

	if p != nil {
		c.recovered(t, p, false, 0)

}

// Run runs body as the body of task t on the calling goroutine, inside the
// task boundary every child started by Go also runs in: a panic becomes a
// defect with t's chain, a stop beats success, and the exit comes back in
// canonical form with a zero value. Emitted main calls it for the root task:
//
//	_, err := rt.Run(rt.Root("main"), mainBody)
//	os.Exit(rt.ExitCode(err))
//
// A law adapter (#124) drives the runtime through the same entry. On a traced
// tree Run raises the start and body-exit events of t.
