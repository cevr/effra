import "time"

// After is timeout.After (runtime.md, Timeouts): an ordinary library function
// over a child task, Interrupt, a drain and a Scheduler timer. It runs body as
// a child of t and returns only after the child has finished, releases
// included.
//
//   - The body finishes first: its value or its exit.
//   - The deadline passes first: the child is stopped and drained, and the exit
//     is the child's defects followed by Expired. The abandoned child's typed
//     failure and the interruption After caused are normalized (laws R3, R8),
//     so a lone Expired stays a catchable typed failure.
//   - t is stopped first or while the body runs: the child is stopped and
//     drained, and the exit is the child's defects with an interruption.
//
// Every exit of After, including a panic in the Scheduler or Timer provider,
// passes one unwind boundary. It stops and drains a child that is still
// running, stops the timer, and adds each cleanup defect after the exit it
// already holds, so a defect in the child is kept on every path (Exit causes,
// rules 3 and 4).
