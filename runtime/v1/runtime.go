// Package v1 is the runtime support that lowered Ergo programs link. The
// lowering (internal/sketch/lower) copies this package's source into every
// emitted module, beside the generated main package, so a program needs no
// module download and its build key covers these exact bytes.
//
// It holds only what lowered code cannot express as ordinary Go: the host's
// providers (Console), the Go bodies of prelude extern declarations
// (Sleep), how main reports a typed failure, and the text of a basic value
// inside an error type's text. A defect is an ordinary Go panic: nothing in
// this file recovers one, so Go's own report names the panicking frame,
// which the //line directives map to the .ergo source.
//
// The bodies of the std packages task, scope, queue and slice are in
// task.go, queue.go and data.go, over runtime/rt; exit.go is the exit
// vocabulary they share and the entry, Main, which records a defect with
// its stack at a task or frame boundary. Their contract is
// docs/spec/runtime.md (Tasks, Exit actions, Queues). The std signatures
// in internal/sketch/std bind them (docs/spec/stdlib.md, v1 packages and
// Hidden arguments). The lowering of those calls (check-v1 stage D) copies
// this package and runtime/rt into a module; until then SourceFiles names
// this file alone.
//
// Prior art: Gleam's prelude.mjs and ReScript's runtime modules ship the
// small host-language support that generated code calls; Borgo emits Go
// that links a small runtime package.
