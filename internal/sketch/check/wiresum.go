// Wire summaries under a counted budget (D16 as amended in rounds 18 and
// 20).
//
// Wire checking asks batch reachability questions over the embedding
// graph: which capabilities each wire reaches, and whether two entries for
// one capability reach one wire (S111). Their answers can be quadratic in
// the source (a ladder of disjoint chains), and batch reachability has no
// known linear algorithm, so no exact checker is linear on every input.
// The pass's work therefore has a two-part bound (round 20):
//
//  1. Repeatable work, whose count can exceed a fixed multiple of the wire
//     source it reads (set nodes read, made or copied, union elements,
//     probes against a summary, a sort), is charged before it runs against
//     one deterministic budget per package, wireBudgetPerUnit × wireSize
//     (capset.go wireMeter).
//  2. Single-pass work reads each wire node a fixed number of times
//     (entries, keys, embeddings, the graph walk's steps, each component's
//     members, each root): it is not charged, and it is at most
//     wireSinglePerUnit × wireSize.
//
// So the pass does at most (wireBudgetPerUnit + wireSinglePerUnit) ×
// wireSize work. When the next repeatable step would pass the budget, the
// checker stops: the wire or the inline wire it was working on gets S111
// (wireBudgetMessage), and every wire not summarised yet binds an unknown
// set and adds no diagnostic of its own, so a with of it discharges
// everything (D3). The checker never accepts a wire it has not proved, as
// S103 never accepts a switch it has not proved total.
//
// The verdict does not depend on the declarations' order (round 19 M2):
// the pass runs once, before any body, over the named wires in name order
// and then over the inline wires grouped by their declaration's name;
// sets are keyed by capability names (capset.go); and every union plan
// follows the wires' names and their entries' order. The charged total is
// a function of the wire graph and its names, and so is the place of the
// refusal.
// Prior art: TypeScript meters instantiations (TS2589, 5,000,000) and
// depth (100), and rustc meters recursion depth (recursion_limit), not
// every node they read; both are deterministic, source-only budgets that
// refuse and leave linear reading to the size of the input. Elixir's typer
// sorts definitions before its recursive traversal (module/types.ex), so
// its traversal does not depend on their order either.

// wireBudgetPerUnit is K, the repeatable work allowed per unit of wire
// source: 128. One step is a set node read, copied or created, an element
// enumerated, a probe against a summary, an override recorded, or a sort's
// comparison or move. A wire costs 3⌈log₂ n⌉ for the name sort, and a
// capability added along a chain about 2·log₂ n + 2 for its path, a few times over (its wire's own
// set, its component's union, a body), so a chain, a fan-in or a large
// base with a chain of 8000 wires uses under a third of the budget
// (TestWireBudget, measured). A small program pays a constant per wire,
// so K must also leave the corpus room: the corpus, the fixtures and the
// examples use under 10% of their budget (TestWireBudgetHeadroom).
const wireBudgetPerUnit = 128

// wireSinglePerUnit is C, the single-pass work per unit of wire source: 12.
// The most a unit costs is a wire declaration with no entry, which the
// pass collects, makes a graph node for, enters, pops, reads as a
// component member, reads its own set for the union, publishes, probes as
// a root, checks for a summary, loops over for its body, sets up a body
// for and checks for a body: twelve operations. An embedding costs at most
// seven (its entry read three times, a graph edge, a member edge, an
// embedding read and a union set read), an entry of k keys, which is
// 1 + k units, 3 + 4k (its entry read three times, each key read twice,
// probed and added once), and an inline wire at most six (its group's
// loop, its read, its store, its body set up and checked, a refusal).
