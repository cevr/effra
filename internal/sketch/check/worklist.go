// The order of the silent body checks (round 8 review M1). Settling the
// calls that wait for typing (selfcalls.go settleWaiting) and the fixpoint
// of a cyclic component (rows.go converge) share one worklist and one
// order:
//
//   - Callees first, on demand. Before a body is checked, every callee it
//     has in the worklist's graph that is still queued is checked first,
//     recursively (a depth-first walk over the edges known at that moment,
//     so an edge typing resolves joins the order at once). A callee that is
//     already on that walk is a cycle: the body is checked with the
//     callee's current rows, and checked again if they grow. So in an
//     acyclic part a body is checked only once all its pending callees have
//     settled, never once per settling callee.
//   - Smallest first among the roots. The next root is the queued body with
//     the fewest syntax nodes (then the lowest postorder index): inside a
//     cycle, where no order puts every callee first, the large bodies wait
//     until the small ones they depend on stop growing. A hub that calls
//     every member of a ring (the reviewer's star) is then checked a
//     constant number of times, whatever order declares the ring.
//   - A body whose rows grow wakes its callers in the worklist, except the
//     callers on the current walk, which are about to be checked anyway.
//
// The cost of one check is the body's size (c.workNodes); the walk visits
// each edge of a body once per check of that body (c.worklistSteps), and a
// body has at most one edge per reference in it, so the walk costs no more
// than the checks.
//
// Prior art: Gleam infers a module's functions in the dependency order of
// their strongly connected components (call_graph::into_dependency_order),
// so a caller is never inferred once per callee; Elixir's parallel compiler
// parks a module until the module it waits on is defined and wakes it
// then; the smallest-first choice inside a cycle is the weighted variant of
// the dataflow worklist (a node's recomputation costs its size).

// bodyHeap is the worklist's queue of bodies, least first (bodyLess). A
// queued body knows its slot; a body that is not queued has slot -1.
