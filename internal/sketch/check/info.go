// The Info contract (check-v1 spec, "Interface to lower-v1"). The lowering
// reads only Check's result and the syntax tree: it never re-derives a
// type, a row or a resolution, and a package with any diagnostic is not
// lowered. In a package with no diagnostic:
//
//  1. Complete: every expression in a body or a package let has a Types
//     entry, every identifier a Defs or Uses entry, every call a Calls
//     entry, every pattern a Patterns entry, every match and catch a
//     Matches entry, every for-in a Loops entry and every with a Withs
//     entry, whose Entries hold its named wire's providers of what its
//     block needs, with their conversions; the wire itself holds the rest
//     (Wire.Provider, Wire.Overrides; TestInfoComplete). A package name before a dot and a
//     built-in callee are no values and have no Types entry. An inline
//     wire value's entries are stage E's (196x).
//  2. Final: no type in Info is invalid or holds a row variable; a type
//     parameter appears only inside its own generic declaration. The one
//     exception is go/types': the name in an explicit instantiation
//     Fn[int] keeps its generic type (round-4 M3).
//  3. Proved: a Match is total, so the lowering adds no default arm except
//     a catch's defect re-panic (rows.md, Catch 6).
//  4. Deterministic: every slice in Package and in Info's values is in
//     source order or by name, never in map order.
//
// Each stage of check-v1 populates the entries of the forms it checks;
// stage A populates every form the merge-round checker types.
//
// Tree names: the tree keeps parse-v1's desugared nodes (spec D-A8, Q8).
// A syntax.VarDecl is a `let`; a SwitchStmt is a `match` on literal
// patterns; a TypeSwitchStmt is any other `match`; a CallExpr whose Fun is
// the identifier `with` is a `with` block; a WireDecl is a package-level
// wire `let`; a RangeStmt is a `for … in`; a ForStmt is a `for` on a
// condition.
//
// Stage B forms (all additive):
//   - A bare record with no fields in value position, `return Pending` or
//     the receiver of `Runner.Each(f)`, is an Ident (or a pkg.T selector)
//     whose Uses entry is the record's *TypeName and whose Types entry is
//     the record type: the lowering writes Pending{}.
//   - An inline variant `Declined{ Reason string }` is a *TypeName in
//     Package.Types, after its union, whose Decl is a TypeDecl the checker
//     builds: its Name is the VariantSpec's (with a Defs entry), its Spec a
//     StructType over the VariantSpec's fields, and its TypeParams the
//     union's parameters the fields mention, as new identifiers that are
//     not in the tree (no Defs entry).
//   - A defined type `type N T` is a *Named whose Underlying is T's and
//     whose Defined is T; a record or union has a nil Defined.
//   - Every pattern node of a match, catch, let or for has a Patterns entry
//     (a ParenExpr shares its inner node's), and a binding's Var is its
//     Defs entry. A package-level `let P = e` defines each name of P as a
//     package *Var.
//     The frozen tree stores a local let's single bare name in VarSpec.Names
//     even when it tests a known type or constant (VarSpec.Pattern is nil).
//     In that case Info.Patterns holds its pattern, Uses names the referred
//     object, and Defs has no binder. Lowering reads that pattern first.
//   - A tuple value `(a, b)` and a tuple type have the *Tuple type; a
//     function's one result may be a tuple, and `let q, r = f()`
//     destructures it.

// Package is a checked package.
