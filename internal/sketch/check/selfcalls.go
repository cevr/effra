// Typed edges of x.f(…) calls (196m; round 6 review M1, round 7 review M1).
//
// A call x.f(…) of a package function on x's type reaches one function,
// which x's type picks. The reference walk resolves the call when x's
// declaration fixes its type (selfCallee), and retires it when x names
// nothing (an S104 whatever the rows); any other call waits here for
// typing, as a method use did in 196a: the round-15 rule, references that
// need types come from typing. No edge is ever taken by name.
//
// Typing a body needs its callees' rows only for the types of function
// values and for the rows of calls (a catch on a call that cannot fail is
// an error), and a call's callee depends only on the head of the
// receiver's type. So each body with a waiting call is typed once,
// silently, from empty inferred rows (the rows of a body typed earlier are
// reset, so the result does not depend on the order of the bodies), and
// every call typing reaches is resolved to its function: one edge per
// call, linear in the source.
//
// A type does not depend on a row: a catch keeps its value's type even on
// a call that cannot fail (handlers.go catch), so the reviewer's
// `let b = w() catch { case E: B{} }; b.m()` resolves from empty rows. One
// form still waits: an arm `case G as g` of a generic error type written
// without type arguments takes G's instance from the caught row, so g.m()
// resolves only once that row holds it. settleWaiting resolves such calls
// over the bodies the waiting bodies reach, the only bodies whose rows
// their typing reads, in the order converge uses (worklist.go).
//
// Prior art: go/types records a method's use when it resolves the selector
// (Info.Uses, LookupFieldOrMethod) and orders initialization by those
// dependencies; MoonBit and Koka resolve x.f by x's inferred type, never
// lexically; rustc resolves methods during type checking, after name
// resolution has fixed every plain path.

// resolveSelfCalls resolves the pending calls x.f(…) of each body by typing
// and adds their edges and class G value uses to the body's references.

// The worklist holds the waiting bodies and every body they reach in the
// graph known so far, the only bodies whose rows their typing reads. A body
// is checked once every pending callee it has has settled (callees first,
// on demand), and again only when a callee's rows grow. A call typing
// resolves adds its edge at once: a callee new to the worklist joins it with
// the bodies it reaches, and the caller is checked again only if that
// callee's rows grow. A waiting body whose calls stay unresolved is checked
// once its callees settle and wakes nobody. The rows restart empty
// afterwards: the reporting order is decided only once every edge is known.
//
// The bound is converge's: 2·(bodies + edges)·(D + 1) checks, where D
// counts the distinct row elements produced so far. Past it the worklist
// stops and the calls left stay unresolved; no known source reaches it
// (rows that only grow fit it, as in converge, whose bound
// TestConvergeBoundOscillation checks). c.selfChecks counts the checks,
// c.workNodes their syntax nodes and c.worklistSteps the bodies and edges
