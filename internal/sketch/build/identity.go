// output: the producer identity of internal/producer, which every check
// envelope also reports. Every byte compiled into the compiler (the
// emitter, the embedded standard library and runtime, a dirty edit)
// reaches the emission key through it.
//
// Where the kernel names the bytes the process executes (/proc/self/exe
// on Linux; on darwin the file at the executable's path, verified against
// the kernel's cdhash of the executing image), the identity is the SHA-256
// of those bytes, so two processes of one executable share published
// modules. A compiler file replaced while the process runs (go install, a
// package manager) cannot lend this process its digest: Linux still names
// the old image, and on darwin the replacement fails verification.
//
// Anywhere else, and whenever verification fails, the identity is
// process-scoped ("process:" and a nonce). It never keys a published
// module: Cache.Module builds such a module in a private root of the
// process and never renames it into the shared modules directory. When
// the producer has no identity at all, building stops with its reason.
//
// Prior art: Go keys its action cache on the build IDs of the compiler and
// tools it runs; Gleam and Mix key on a compiler version string, which a
// dirty build does not change; Bazel's action keys include the digests of
// the tools an action runs.
