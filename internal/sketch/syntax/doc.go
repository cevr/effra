// Package syntax is the lexer, AST and parser of Ergo: the decided grammar
// of #196 (docs/spec/grammar.md is normative). The parser accepts that
// grammar and nothing else; an old Go-shaped spelling is a diagnostic, and a
// Go habit's message names the Ergo form (habits.go).
//
// A decided form that means the same as a Go-shaped node becomes that node
// (`let` a VarDecl, `match` a SwitchStmt or TypeSwitchStmt, `fails` an
// ErrorRow), so the consumers keep reading one tree; nodes no decided form
// produces stay declared until their consumers are rewritten, and the
// parser never builds them (TestDecidedOnly).
//
// The package resolves no names; the checker (#196), the LSP (#38) and the
// formatter (internal/sketch/format) consume its AST. Every syntax error is
// S001 (docs/spec/diagnostics.md), or S108 for a type that mixes fields and
// operations, with a byte span, line and byte column; Parse reports the
// first error and returns no file.
//
// Prior art, where the package chooses between options:
//   - go/ast, go/parser: types are expressions, every node has Pos and End,
//     comments are kept as CommentGroups beside the tree (File.Comments) with
//     Doc groups on declarations; the composite-literal rule in control
//     clause headers; parameter grouping; nesting is bounded.
//   - cmd/compile/internal/syntax: one package for tokens, scanner and parser;
//     positions are byte offsets resolved through a line table.
//   - ReScript's parser maps a new surface onto the tree the old front end
//     produced, so the checker stays unchanged; rustc names other
//     languages' habits ("Rust has no postfix increment operator").
//   - The printer lives apart (internal/sketch/format), as go/printer does,
//     so no checker or lowering code depends on layout.
