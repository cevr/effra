// Package testenv names the environment a cached Go test may receive.
//
// Observation (package testinputs) keys a variable only if a process
// received it or the test process looked it up. A program run by a test that
// reads a variable absent when the result was cached leaves no trace, since
// its lookup is a library call, not a system call, so setting the variable
// later replays the cached result. cmd/go's test log cannot say "every
// variable, present or not". A runner closes the gap by passing a cached
// test only the variables named here, as Bazel's strict action environment
// and Nix's pure builds do, and by keying their values (the gate puts them in
// ToolDigest). Any other variable cannot reach the test, so it cannot be an
// unkeyed input.
