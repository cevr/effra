// Package testport gives a test a loopback address that no other socket on
// the host can be assigned until the test ends.
//
// A test learns a server's address by letting the server bind port 0 and
// reading the address it reports, as net/http/httptest does. A reservation
// is for the two cases that cannot work that way: a program that must be
// told its address before it starts, and a test that binds an address again
// after the server released it to prove the release. Closing a probe
// listener and handing its port over instead, or rebinding a released port,
// leaves a window in which another test can take the port (#112).
//
// Reservation needs Linux bind semantics (reserve_linux.go). BSD kernels
// refuse a listener on an address that a bound, non-listening SO_REUSEADDR
// socket holds unless both sockets set SO_REUSEPORT, and the runtimes do not
// set it.

// reservation is possible. It is for a test whose every step needs an
