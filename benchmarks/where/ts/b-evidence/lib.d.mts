// #125 INPUT EVIDENCE, NOT ACCEPTANCE (note §2.10). The evidence mechanism is
// #125's; this fixture models only the outward boundary rule, under which an
// exported function that mints evidence takes one of two forms in the .d.mts.
// It does not model inward admission, a stable payload or a private canonical
// method: attacks-expected-fail.mts records those routes as expected failures.
//
//   (i)  It binds the canonical methods on the Effra side. Its signature has
//        no method parameter, so a TypeScript caller cannot choose the
//        comparator, and the evidence it returns crosses outward.
//   (ii) It accepts the methods from its caller (a where clause or a generic
//        forwarding function). Its projection drops the evidence and returns
//        the unbranded carried type; Effra re-establishes the evidence before
//        trusting a value that comes back.
//
// Evidence is a type-only brand keyed by an unexported unique symbol and
// named by the canonical method's declaration identity. The runtime value is
// the carried value itself.
