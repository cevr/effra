# spike-laws TS caller view (#125). For each directory: tsc strict on every
# .mts (each file on its own, because one attack augments globals); node runs
# the consumer and the attacks; every @ts-expect-error is opened to show the
# diagnostic it suppresses, with the declared code; `any` is counted in the
# declarations, the runtime and the probes.
#
# proto/ is the prototype's emitted library (wf10/spike-laws-proto) under the
# four boundary rules: its attacks must each be refused (EF186 or TypeError) or
# be harmless. counterfactual/ is the same library with naive trust: its
# attacks must still reach a wrong answer, so the comparison stays live.
#
# TypeScript is the repository's pinned copy (tools/lib.sh); node >= 22.6 runs
# .mts directly. Exits 1 when any tsc or node run fails, a directive
# suppresses nothing or fires with another code, or an `any` keyword appears.
# Usage: benchmarks/laws/ts/run.sh
