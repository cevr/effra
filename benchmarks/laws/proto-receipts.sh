# Regenerates the laws prototype receipts in benchmarks/laws/runs/ (#125):
#   erasure-diff.txt  each law example built with and without its contract and
#                     satisfies blocks (replaced by blank lines so line
#                     directives do not move); only the revision header may differ.
#   seed-survey.txt   the broken compare and the seed-sensitive near-order probe
#                     under the default and exploration root seeds on both
#                     targets; exploration receipts have their own path.
# The prototype lives on wf10/spike-laws-proto, which is never merged, so pass
# a checkout of that branch. Exits 1 when an output differs beyond the header,
# a seed run disagrees across targets, or a tool is missing.
# Usage: benchmarks/laws/proto-receipts.sh <proto-checkout> [scratch-dir]
