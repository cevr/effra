# Resources and automatic release

Status: **designed, not yet implemented**. The prototype has no resources. This file follows the owner's direction of 2026-10-26 ("How can we make it simpler so that defers are automatic … Kind of like acquire release"), adopted in the body of [#65](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/65). It replaces the earlier rules that made a resource linear with a checked `defer` and registered constructor resources with `build.Scope` (README Gap 13). Definitions of resource, owner scope, move, lend and consume are in the [glossary](../../GLOSSARY.md).

The guarantee is Effect's `acquireRelease`: if an acquisition succeeds, its release runs, once, on every exit. The spelling is Go's: no `defer` to write and none to forget.

```go
func copyFile(src, dst string) fails NotFound | WriteFailed needs FS {
	let input = try FS.Open(src)
	let out = try FS.Create(dst) // if this fails, input is still closed
	try io.Copy(out, input)      // lends out and input
} // out closed, then input
```

## What is a resource

1. **R1.** A type is a resource when it has a method `Close()`, when it is a struct with a resource field, or when it is a slice, array or map with a resource element type (R34). A `Task` and an actor handle are resources ([runtime.md](runtime.md#tasks)).
2. **R2.** `Close` must not declare an error row (decision #6). A defect in `Close` joins the exit cause ([runtime.md](runtime.md#exit-causes)). A fallible cleanup handles its failure inside `Close`: `p.conn.Close() catch { case CloseFailed: log.Warn("close failed") }`. *Prior art:* Effect's release has error type `never`; Go's `io.Closer` returns an error that callers routinely drop.
3. **R3. Generated `Close`.** A struct whose fields include resources gets a generated `Close` that closes those fields in reverse declaration order. A hand-written `Close` on such a struct adds behaviour that runs first; the generated field releases still run after it.

## Owner scope

1. **R4.** Every resource value has exactly one owner scope: the block that acquired it, or the scope it moved to.
2. **R5. Release at scope end.** When an owner scope ends, it closes each resource it still owns, in reverse acquisition order. This holds on every exit: normal completion, `return`, an escaping failure, a defect and interruption.
3. **R6. Loop iterations.** The body of a loop is its own owner scope. A resource acquired in an iteration is closed at the end of that iteration, not at function exit.

   ```go
   func importAll(paths []string) fails NotFound needs FS {
   	for p in paths {
   		let f = try FS.Open(p)
   		try load(f)
   	} // f closed at the end of each iteration
   }
   ```

   *Prior art:* Go's `defer` runs at function exit, which leaks one file per iteration; C# `using var` and Python `with` scope to the block.
4. **R7. Failure during acquisition.** When a later acquisition in a scope fails, the resources acquired earlier in that scope are closed before the failure escapes (`copyFile` above).
5. **R8. Atomic registration.** A successful acquisition and its registration for release are one step: interruption cannot fall between them (I2, [runtime.md](runtime.md#i2-automatic-masks)).
6. **R9. Release runs masked.** Releases run uninterruptibly, to completion, even when the scope ends by interruption. Each release runs even when an earlier one had a defect, and every defect is kept in the exit cause.

## Moves

A move transfers ownership. After a move, the source binding is unusable, and using it is an error.

1. **R10. Return.** `return r` moves `r` to the caller, which becomes its owner scope.
2. **R11. Provider field.** A resource stored in a field of a provider that `wire` builds moves into the provider. The provider is a resource (R1), and the `with` block that built it closes it when the block ends.
3. **R12. `go`.** A `go` task that captures a resource lends it when the structured-lend rule (R27) holds, and moves it into the task otherwise. A moved resource is closed by the task's scope when the task ends.
4. **R13. Channel send.** In v0 a channel whose element type is a resource is an error, so no resource moves by a send ([Channels](#channels); README Gap 30).
5. **R14. Aggregate construction (README Gap 15).** Building a struct value with a resource field moves the resource into the struct. The struct is a resource and has the same owner scope as the binding that receives it. Building a slice, array or map with resource elements moves them into the container ([Containers](#containers)).
6. **R15. Assignment.** `q := r` moves `r` to `q`. There are no copies of a resource, so two releases of one acquisition cannot be scheduled. *Prior art:* Rust moves by default; Swift `~Copyable` types are moved and `consume`d.

## Structured lend

A task may use a resource that it does not own when the task is certain to be stopped and drained before the borrow of that resource ends.

1. **R27. Borrow lifetime.** `go f(x)`, or a `go` block that captures `x`, **lends** `x` to the task, instead of moving it, when the resulting `Task` is guaranteed to be released (stopped and drained) before the borrow of `x` ends, on every exit. The borrow's end is fixed by the root owner of `x`:
   - **Root owner.** The checker keeps, for every borrowed value, its root owner and that owner's release point. A local resource is its own root, owned by the scope that binds it. A value reached by indexing (R35), by a field of an owned aggregate, or by capture in a non-escaping closure (R30) inherits the root owner of the value it was reached from: `files[0]` has the root owner of `files`. A borrow ends at the root owner's release point, which is the lexical end of the root owner's scope (R5), or the release of the enclosing aggregate (R3, R37).
   - **Incoming borrows.** A parameter (R16), and a value reached from it, has a root owner outside the call, which outlives the call. As seen from the callee, its borrow ends when the function returns. Only incoming borrows take this bound. Inside a non-escaping closure, a captured borrow is an incoming borrow of the closure, bounded by the closure's return.
   - **Release before the end.** The `Task` must be owned by a scope or aggregate that is released before the borrow's end on every exit, including the automatic release edges of R5 and R3 on normal completion, `return`, failure, defect and interruption. Each of these satisfies the condition: the `Task` is bound after the root owner in the same owner scope, so reverse acquisition order (R5) stops and drains it first; the `Task` is owned by a scope nested inside the root owner's scope, which ends first; the `Task` is stored in a struct field declared after the root owner's field, so the generated `Close` (R3) stops and drains it first; or the `Task` is stored in a container or aggregate whose own owner satisfies one of these conditions. For an incoming borrow, every scope local to the function qualifies, because each one is released before the function returns.
   - Moving or returning the `Task` to an owner that does not satisfy the condition is an error.

   Otherwise the capture moves `x` when the function owns `x` (R12), and is an error when `x` is lent to the function (R17) or borrowed through an index or a field, since a borrow cannot move its element out (R35, R36).

   *Prior art:* Rust's `std::thread::scope` requires the borrowed environment (`'env`) to outlive the thread scope (`'scope`), so every scoped thread is joined before the borrowed data can be dropped. R27 is that inequality, checked against the root owner's release point instead of a written lifetime.
2. **R28.** While a task holds a structured lend of `x`, `x` and its root owner must not be consumed, moved alone or converted. Consuming the task first (`t.Stop()`, `t.Wait()`) ends the lend. Moving `x` and the task together into one aggregate keeps the lend when the aggregate preserves their order (R27).
3. **Lossless wrapping.** A helper receives `x` as an incoming borrow whose root owner outlives the call, so any task that the helper releases before it returns satisfies R27. Moving code that starts and drains a task into a helper function therefore never turns a valid program into an invalid one. This keeps the owner's composability rule ([glossary](../../GLOSSARY.md), "Composability checks"). *Prior art:* Swift task groups end every child before `withTaskGroup` returns, so children may use the caller's borrowed values; Rust's `std::thread::scope` lets scoped threads borrow from the enclosing function because they are joined before `scope` returns.
4. **R29.** Inside one composite literal, a field value may be a `task.Go` call that lends a resource given to an earlier field of the same literal. The elements are evaluated in order, and the literal satisfies R27 when it completes.

```go
type Postgres {
	pool    sql.Pool,   // declared first: released last
	refresh Task[Unit], // declared after pool: stopped and drained first
}

func OpenPostgres() Postgres fails ConnectFailed needs Config, Clock, Scheduler {
	let pool = try retry.On[ConnectFailed](retry.Exponential(200ms).Times(5)) {
		sql.Open(Config.String("DATABASE_URL"))
	}
	// pool moves into field pool; task.Go() { keepWarm(pool) } lends it, because its task
	// lands in field refresh, declared after pool (R27, R29). Nothing closes here.
	return Postgres{pool, task.Go() { keepWarm(pool) }}
}
```

Negative examples, each an error:

```go
type Bad {
	refresh Task[Unit], // declared before pool: would be stopped after pool closes
	pool    sql.Pool,
}
func openBad() Bad {
	let p = open()
	return Bad{task.Go() { keepWarm(p) }, p}
} // p is moved into the task by R12, then used: error

func early() {
	let p = open()
	let t = task.Go() { keepWarm(p) } // structured lend: t is bound after p
	p.Close()                         // error: p is lent to t, which may still run (R28)
	t.Stop()
}

func leak(p Pool) Task[Unit] {
	let t = task.Go() { poll(p) } // p is lent to leak
	return t                      // error: the task would outlive the borrow of p (R27)
}

func bad() {
	let mut running = Map[int64, Task[Unit]]{} // owned by bad's scope
	with wire {} {
		let files = []File{open()}                // root owner of files[0]: this block
		running[0] = task.Go() { read(files[0]) } // error: running is released at the end of bad,
		"done" // after files is released at the end of this block (R27)
	}
	waitForChildRead()
}
```

A lent parameter, allowed:

```go
func useOnce(p Pool) {
	let t = task.Go() { poll(p) } // structured lend: t is owned by useOnce's scope, released before useOnce returns
	t.Stop()
}
```

The corrected forms of `bad`, allowed:

```go
func good() {
	with wire {} {
		let files = []File{open()}
		let mut running = Map[int64, Task[Unit]]{} // bound after files in the same block
		running[0] = task.Go() { read(files[0]) }  // running is released first (R5, R37)
		"done"
	}
}

func goodTask() {
	with wire {} {
		let files = []File{open()}
		let t = task.Go() { read(files[0]) } // t is owned by the block, bound after files
		watch(t)                             // lends t; the block stops and drains t before it closes files (R5)
		"done"
	}
}
```

*Prior art:* Trio nurseries and Swift structured concurrency both guarantee that child tasks end before the scope that started them ends, which is what makes the lend safe; Effect's `forkScoped` ties a fiber to the scope that owns the resources it uses.

## Lending

1. **R16.** Passing a resource as an argument lends it. The caller keeps ownership, and the resource is usable again after the call.
2. **R17.** A lent resource must not be stored, returned, sent or captured by an escaping closure or by `go` inside the callee, except by a structured lend (R27, R31) to a task or owner that the callee releases before it returns. Each of these is an error. A call that lends `r` while `r` is consumed in the same call is an error.
3. **R18.** Lending needs no lifetime annotations, because a lent value cannot escape the call. *Prior art:* Swift non-escaping borrowed parameters; Rust borrows, whose lifetimes Ergo drops because a lend never escapes.
4. A lend of a `Task` lets the callee read it but not `Wait` or `Stop` it.

## Closures

1. **R30.** A non-escaping closure, including a trailing block, lends every resource it captures for the duration of the call it is passed to.
2. **R31.** An escaping closure may capture a resource only under the structured-lend rule: the owner that keeps the closure must be released before the borrow of each captured resource ends, on every exit (R27). The end is the release point of the resource's root owner, or the function's return for an incoming borrow; a resource reached by indexing or through a field has the root owner of its container or aggregate. In `set.Go(func() { actor.Pump(b, signals) })`, the Set keeps the literal, so `set` must be released before `b`: `set` is bound after `b` in the same owner scope.
3. **R32.** While such a closure may still run, consuming the captured resource is an error. `b.Stop()` before `set` is consumed is an error.
4. **R33.** Every other escaping capture of a resource is an error. *Prior art:* Swift does not let an escaping closure capture a `borrowing` parameter of non-copyable type; Rust requires `move` closures to own what they capture, or a lifetime that outlives them.

```go
func run(signals queue.Queue[Signal]) needs Probe, Clock, Scheduler {
	let b = actor.Start(Breaker{}, 16)
	let set = tasks.Set(tasks.Restart(schedule.Exponential(1s).UpTo(5))) // bound after b
	set.Go(func() { actor.Pump(b, signals) })                            // structured lend of b (R31)
	let d = try b.Ask(Retry{}) catch {
	case ProbeDown:
		Reject{}
	}
} // set stopped, then b stopped
```

The 2026-10-26 sketch bound `set` before `b`; that order is an error under R31, because `b` would stop while the Set could still run the literal.

## Containers

1. **R34.** A slice, array or map whose element type is a resource is itself a resource.
2. **R35.** Copying such a container moves it (R15). Indexing it, `xs[i]`, lends the element; the element's borrow keeps the root owner of `xs` (R27). Calling a consuming method through an index (`xs[i].Close()`, `running[j].Wait()`, `ts[k].Stop()`) is an error.
3. **R36.** A standard-library removal moves the element out: `slices.Take(xs, i)` for a slice, and the map's delete-and-return (`m.Take(k)`). The element then has the caller's scope as owner.
4. **R37.** Releasing a container releases its remaining elements: a slice or array in reverse index order, a map in unspecified order. Each release runs even when an earlier one had a defect (R9).
5. **R40. Resource map keys.** A map whose key type is a resource is an error in v0 (S112, designed). Only map values may be resources. README Gap 32 records a later owned-key rule.

```go
func moves(f File) {
	let xs = []File{f} // f moves into xs (R14)
	let ys = xs        // xs moves into ys (R35)
	xs[0].Close()      // error: xs was moved, and Close through an index is a consume (R35)
	read(ys[0])        // allowed: ys[0] is lent to read
}

func keys() Map[Key, string] {
	return Map[Key, string]{openKey(): "v"} // error: Key is a resource, so it cannot be a map key (R40)
}
```

*Prior art:* Rust's `Vec<T>` forbids moving out by index and moves out through `Vec::remove` and `swap_remove`; Ergo keeps that shape and chooses reverse order for release, to match its scope rule (R5). Rust's `HashMap<K, V>` owns and drops its keys as well as its values; Ergo defers owned keys (R40) rather than add key extraction and replacement rules in v0.

## Channels

1. **R38.** In v0, a channel whose element type is a resource is an error (README Gap 30 records the recommended later rule).

## Partial moves

1. **R39.** Moving a single field out of a struct is an error in v0; move the whole struct. `p := pg.pool` where `pool` is a resource field is an error; the field may be lent (`ping(pg.pool)`). *Prior art:* Rust allows partial moves and then forbids using the whole; Swift forbids consuming a stored property of a non-copyable value outside its `consuming` methods. v0 takes the stricter rule.

## Early release

1. **R19. Consume.** Calling `r.Close()` consumes `r`. So do `task.Wait()`, `task.Stop()` and an actor's `Stop()`. After a consume, nothing runs for `r` at scope end.
2. **R20.** Using a consumed resource is an error. Consuming it twice is an error.
3. **R21. Paths.** At each point where an owner scope ends, the checker knows for each resource whether it is owned, moved or consumed. A resource moved or consumed on one path and not on another is closed at scope end only on the paths where it is still owned.

## Conversions

1. **R22 (README Gap 14).** Converting a resource to an interface type that has no `Close` is an error. Ownership is never erased by a conversion.
2. **R23.** Converting a resource to an interface type that has `Close` moves it. The interface value is a resource with the same owner scope.

## Wire

1. **R24.** A constructor that returns a resource gives its release to the `with` that built it. The build closes its providers in reverse dependency order, dependents first, when the `with` block ends.
2. **R25.** Provider release runs to completion under interruption (R9), and a release defect joins the exit cause beside the body's outcome.
3. **R26.** A `Task` stored in a provider field is a provider resource. The provider's generated `Close` stops and drains it, as Effect's `forkScoped` does. `Wait` gives its result instead.

## `defer`

`defer` stays for statements that are not releases, such as `defer done <- i`. `defer r.Close()` on a resource the scope owns is an error, because the scope already releases `r`; consume it with `r.Close()` where it should end early. *Prior art:* Zig keeps explicit `defer` and `errdefer` to avoid hidden control flow; Ergo answers that cost with visibility (below).

## Visibility

1. The language server shows an inlay hint `closes: out, in` at each block end that releases resources.
2. `ergo inspect` lists every inserted release with its source position, and every move and consume.

## Lowering

The emitted Go is the `defer` a careful Go programmer writes, with an exit accumulator so that a release defect is not lost. A loop body becomes its own Go function, or gets an explicit close on each exit edge; both shapes are measured before one is chosen ([#190](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/190)).

## Prior art

- **Rust `Drop` with moves.** The model. Ergo keeps moves and drops lifetimes, because a lent value cannot escape.
- **Swift `~Copyable`.** `consume`, `deinit` and non-escaping borrowed parameters.
- **C# `using var` and Python `with`.** Scoped release with a marker at each binding. Ergo infers it from the type.
- **Gleam `use`.** `use f <- with_file(path)` flattens callback-scoped cleanup; it is explicit, and each resource needs a wrapper function.
- **Elixir/OTP.** A port or file belongs to its process and closes when the process exits. Ergo's per-task scope has the same "the owner's end releases it" rule.
- **Effect.** `acquireRelease`, `Scope`, `addFinalizer`, `ensuring` and `forkScoped`, replaced by one rule.
