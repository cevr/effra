# Standard library outline

Status: **designed, not yet implemented**, except the prelude's `Console` (`Println`) and the `Sleep` of its live scheduler, which `ergo build` lowers ([runtime.md](runtime.md#host-and-lowering-notes)). The checker admits `timeout.After` ([runtime.md](runtime.md#timeouts)); its lowering, with the other prelude and std extern bodies, is lower-v1 stage 3, and a build that uses it is refused with S109 until then. The four v1 packages `task`, `scope`, `queue` and `slice` have Ergo signatures, which the checker checks like user code, bound to Go bodies in `runtime/v1` ([v1 packages](#v1-packages-task-scope-queue-and-slice)); their lowering is check-v1 stage D, and until then `ergo build` refuses a call of them with S109.

The standard library is the "Effect for Go" track, [#206](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/206). Its module map is the contract: each family states the Effect modules it covers, the construct it uses and its tier. Modules are restated in Ergo's idioms, not ported API for API. Effect is prior art for the guarantees, not a dependency (owner, 2026-10-26). Go names are kept wherever Go has one. Definitions are in the [glossary](../../GLOSSARY.md).

**Tiers.**
- **kernel**: a checker or runtime rule the module needs.
- **library**: ordinary Ergo code over the kernel, with no compiler branch keyed on its identity.
- **host**: a host package, the only code that calls Go.

Out of scope for now: durable workflows.

## Prelude

The prelude is in scope in every package without an import: `Option`, `Task`, `Decision`, `Clock`, `Scheduler`, `Random` and `Console`. The four capabilities are ordinary interfaces bound by `wire` (decision #102), so a test replaces any of them ([#209](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/209)).

## v1 packages: task, scope, queue and slice

Language v1 ([#196](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/196)) has four small std packages beside the prelude. A file imports each one it uses; none is ambient (parse-v1 ruling 6). Each pairs ordinary Ergo signatures with a Go body in `runtime/v1`, bound by the identity of the declaration it implements, never by its target text ([runtime.md](runtime.md#host-and-lowering-notes), Extern bodies). The signatures are `extern go` declarations in `internal/sketch/std/task`, `scope`, `queue` and `slice`; the checker checks them, and a program that imports them, with the rules of user code. Their lowering is check-v1 stage D.

| Package | Signatures | Contract | Go body |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | `func Go[T, E, R](body func() T fails E needs R) Task[T, E] needs R`; the prelude's `Task[T, E]` has `Wait() T fails E` and `Stop()` | [runtime.md, Tasks](runtime.md#tasks) rules 7 to 12 | `Go(s *Scope, span Site, body func(*rt.Task) (T, error)) *Task[T]`; the methods `Wait`, `Stop` and `Move(dest *Scope)`, the return of a Task, which only the lowering calls (task.go) |
| `scope` | `func OnExit[R](body func() needs R) needs R` | [runtime.md, Exit actions](runtime.md#exit-actions) | `OnExit(s *Scope, body func())` (task.go) |
| `queue` | `type Closed {}`; `type Queue[T] { Push(v T) fails Closed, Pop() T fails Closed, Close() }`; `func New[T](capacity int) Queue[T]` | [runtime.md, Queues](runtime.md#queues) | `New(capacity int) *Queue[T]`; the methods `Push(t *rt.Task, v T) error`, `Pop(t *rt.Task) (T, error)`, `Close()`, and `Values(t *rt.Task) iter.Seq[T]`; `Closed` (queue.go) |
| `slice` | `func WithCapacity[T](n int) []T` | below | `WithCapacity(n int) []T` (data.go) |

**Not yet: `Values`.** `q.Values()` returns `Seq[T]` (lower-v1 Q1), and the prelude has no `Seq[T]` yet, so the Ergo `Queue` does not declare it. Its Go body is in queue.go. check-v1 stage D adds the prelude's `Seq[T]` and its loop domain, and then `Values() Seq[T]` joins `Queue`. A `for` over the queue is never an eagerly collected slice.

**Hidden arguments.** Some Go bodies need a value that the Ergo signature does not show and the lowering supplies at the call. The Go body names each one by its Go type, which no Ergo type lowers to, so the body's own signature is the binding; there is no attribute in the Ergo source:

1. `*Scope` is the **frame**: the frame scope of the innermost source function at the call ([Exit actions](runtime.md#exit-actions) 5). In an exit action's block, it is the scope of the function that registered the action; the scope itself routes to the action's frame. `task.Go` and `scope.OnExit` take it, and so does every function whose result holds a `Task`, as its hidden destination ([Tasks](runtime.md#tasks) rule 8): its return is `Task.Move(dest)`.
2. `Site` is the **site**: the call's Ergo identity, the called declaration and the call's source position, such as `task.Go at main.ergo:12:10`. `task.Go` names the task by it, which a defect's task chain shows ([G2](runtime.md#g2-fork-tree-defects); [#230](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/230)).
3. `*rt.Task` is the **task**: the task that runs the call. `Push`, `Pop` and `Values` take it, because a stop of that task ends their wait ([Queues](runtime.md#queues) rule 8).

The hidden parameters come first, in this order, each at most once; a hidden type after an ordinary parameter breaks the convention. The parameters after them stand for the Ergo parameters, one each, in order. The Go results are the Ergo results, then `error` when the Ergo signature has an error row. A function parameter is a Go function under the same convention: the block of `task.Go` is `func(*rt.Task) (T, error)`, which receives the child's task, and the lowering adapts its function value to that shape (the block's providers are captured, never passed). An operation of a type that a std extern returns (`queue.Queue[T]`, the prelude's `Task[T, E]`) is the method of that name on the Go type the extern's body returns (`*Queue[T]`, `*Task[T]`), under the same convention; the Go interface the lowering emits for the type has the same method shapes, so the runtime's value is a value of it, and a user type that has the operations passes through an adapter that drops the hidden arguments. `v1.BodyOf` (runtime/v1/files.go, compiler only) reads a body's shape from the embedded source, as the lowering reads it; `TestBodiesFollowTheHiddenConvention` pins each body's shape, and the test of `internal/sketch/std` ties each extern and operation to its body. *Prior art:* Gleam's `@external(erlang, "m", "f")` and ReScript's `external f: t = "f"` bind a host function by name with the signature the source states and pass nothing hidden; Go's own `iter.Seq` carries its stop through `yield`; Effect passes its fiber context implicitly through the runtime; Kotlin passes a hidden `Continuation` as the last parameter of a `suspend` function, the closest relative of the hidden task here.

**Types.** Each Ergo type in a std signature has one Go type, which the body writes and the lowering must use:

1. A basic type is its Go type (`int` is `int`), a type parameter keeps its name, and `[]T` is a Go slice.
2. A row parameter (`E`, `R` in `task.Go[T, E, R]`) has no Go type parameter: rows are erased (rows.md), so the body is `Go[T any]`, and `Task[T, E]` is `*Task[T]`. The type parameters left after erasure are the Go ones, with the same names in order and the same constraint (none or `any` is `any`, `comparable` is `comparable`), so the checker admits a type argument exactly when the Go call compiles: every v1 body takes `T any`, and `slice.WithCapacity[[]int](3)` is valid on both sides. An operation takes the type parameters of its type (`Queue[T]`, `Task[T, E]`). An error row is the last Go result `error`; a capability row is captured by the lowered block, never passed.
3. An operations type that a std extern returns (`queue.Queue[T]`, the prelude's `Task[T, E]`) is a Go interface that the lowering emits, with the methods of the bodies (hidden arguments included). The runtime type that the extern's body returns, `*v1.Queue[T]` or `*v1.Task[T]`, is a value of that interface, and a user type with the operations passes through an adapter.
4. A record type declared in a v1 package, which is not an operations type, is the exported `runtime/v1` struct type of the same name, with the same fields: `queue.Closed` is `v1.Closed`. The lowering never generates a struct for it, because `Push` and `Pop` return `v1.Closed{}`, and a `catch` arm `case queue.Closed:` must match that value. An error type's Go text is its Ergo name: `v1.Closed{}.Error()` is `queue.Closed`.

The std test compares each Ergo type parameter, parameter and result type with its body's Go one under these rules (`TestEachExternHasItsGoBody`), and ties each record of a v1 package to its Go struct and text (`TestStdTypesBindRuntimeTypes`, through `v1.StructFields`).

**Slices and Maps.** `slice.WithCapacity[T](n)` is an empty slice with room for `n` elements; it makes no element, and a negative `n` is a defect, as Go's `make` panics. There is no `slice.Repeat`: not every type has a zero value (parse-v1 ruling 7). The prelude's `xs.Append(x)` returns the slice with `x` at the end, `m.Get(k)` returns `Option[V]` and `m.Delete(k)` returns the Map without `k` (check-v1 D-D6). `Append` and `Delete` have Go bodies in data.go. `Get` builds the program's own `Option`, so its body is lowered at the call. A slice and a Map alias as in Go in v1: `Append` may share the array, and `Delete` changes the Map it is given ([#222](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/222), [#197](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/197)). *Prior art:* Go `make([]T, 0, n)` and `append`; Gleam's `list` module and Elixir's `Enum` keep collection functions out of the prelude.

## Packages by origin

- **Same as Go:** `strings`, `slices`, `maps`, `cmp`, `math`, `time`, `os`, `fs`, `net`, `sql`.
- **Same name, extended:**
  - `http`: client, handlers, routes, server limits;
  - `json`: `Codec`, `Decode`, `Encode`, `ParseX`/`Wire`;
  - `sync`: `Ref`, `TxRef`, `Atomically`, `Latch`;
  - `testing`: `T`, `VirtualClock`, `Discard`, `Idle`.
- **New:** `tasks`, `schedule` (the schedule algebra, with laws), `retry`, `timeout`, `trace`, `log`, `metric`, `batch`, `actor`, `html`.

## Tasks

[#207](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/207). `tasks.Map(xs, limit, f)` keeps input order and runs at most `limit` calls at once; `limit >= 1` is a precondition. It waits for whichever task ends first, so a failure stops the rest promptly. It collects into `[]Option[B]` slots. `tasks.Race` is n-ary. `tasks.Set` is G4 ([runtime.md](runtime.md#g4-tasksset)). The race and fail-fast laws pass as tests. *Prior art:* Go `errgroup` with `SetLimit`; Effect `Effect.forEach` with `concurrency`; Elixir `Task.async_stream` keeps order with `ordered: true`.

## Sync and STM

[#208](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/208).

1. `sync.Ref`, `Latch`, `Semaphore` and `Deferred`. A blocking wait is an interruption point.
2. `sync.TxRef[T]`, `sync.Atomically() { … }` and `sync.Retry()`. `Load` and `Store` need the `sync.Tx` capability, which only `Atomically` provides.
3. A transaction can re-run, so its body is a replayable parameter ([types.md](types.md#function-values)): its footprint holds only `sync.Tx`, and I/O inside a transaction is an error.
4. `Retry` rolls back, registers the read set and waits, interruptibly, until a `TxRef` it read changes. No lock-freedom or starvation-freedom is claimed.

*Prior art:* Haskell STM, ZIO STM, Effect `TxRef`; Go offers mutexes only.

## Batching

[#68](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/68). A provider implements `FindMany`, and `wire` wraps it: `Users = batch.Resolve(UsersDB, batch.Window(2ms), batch.Max(100))`. Go has no scheduler tick to batch on, so the window is explicit. Duplicate keys share one result. A stopped waiter leaves the batch; the batch is cancelled when no waiter is left. "One query" holds only when every call arrives inside the window. *Prior art:* DataLoader states its scheduling policy; Haxl, ZIO Query and Effect `RequestResolver` batch per round.

## HTTP

[#51](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/51). A handler is an ordinary `func(http.Request) http.Response`. A `catch` without `try` must cover every error, so a handler cannot leave a decode, handler or encode failure without a status. Routes use Go 1.22 `ServeMux` patterns: `"POST /orders": placeOrder`. Tests call `api.Serve(req)` with no server. Declared difference: an unmatched method answers 405, as `ServeMux` does. Open trade: handlers lose codec identity, so `ergo inspect` derives endpoint metadata from signatures and literal statuses in `catch` arms. *Prior art:* Effect `HttpApi` declares endpoints; Go `net/http` handlers; Phoenix controllers.

## HTML

[#212](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/212). Owner decision, 2026-10-26: HTML is "Functions", not markup syntax. There is no markup grammar.

```go
import html

func OrderRow(o Order) html.Node {
	return html.Tr([]html.Child{
		html.Class(statusClass(o.Status)),
		html.Td([]html.Child{html.Text(o.Member.Name)}),
		html.Td([]html.Child{html.Int(o.Quantity.Wire())}),
	})
}
```

1. The `html` package is ordinary functions: elements (`Tr`, `Td`, `P`, …), attributes (`Class`, `Href`, …), `Text`, `Int`, `Each` and `When`. A component is a function that returns `html.Node`.
2. An element takes one slice, `[]Child`, where `Child` is the closed union `Attr | Node`; Ergo has no variadic parameters. A void element such as `Br` or `Img` takes only `[]Attr`, so it cannot get children.
3. Escaping is decided by type. `Text` escapes its string; only an `html.Node` is inserted as markup. `Href` and `Src` take a `url.Safe`, not a string. `Raw` takes an `html.Trusted`, which only `html.Trust` builds, so `ergo inspect` lists every trust site.
4. **Lowering.** `html.Node` is a render function that writes to a buffered writer; `Text` escapes at write time, so no intermediate string is built. Folding static subtrees at compile time is a later, measured optimisation. `http.HTML(status, node)` renders a node into a response.

*Prior art:* Gleam Lustre (`html.td([], [text(name)])`), whose surface Ergo takes; Elm `Html`, which escapes by type with separate attribute and child lists, merged here into one `[]Child` slice of the union, so an element takes one argument; templ (Go), whose render-function representation Ergo takes, not its syntax; Phoenix HEEx (Elixir), whose compile-time validation Ergo gets from closed types instead of a parser.

## Host packages

[#210](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/210). `os`, `fs`, `net` and `sql` are the only standard-library code that calls Go. They are reviewed. Every blocking call has a cancel hook, or is recorded as an uninterruptible host wait that `ergo inspect` lists (G8). Each package states the Go targets it supports. File handles are resources ([resources.md](resources.md)). Through host packages and `import go`, every effect appears in a footprint ([rows.md](rows.md#footprints)).

## Testing

[#209](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/209). `testing.VirtualClock` provides `Clock` and `Scheduler` and jumps to the next timer when every task in the test is blocked. `T.Idle()` reports the tasks that keep a test from reaching idle. The test harness is an ordinary `wire`, so production code needs no change to run on virtual time. *Prior art:* Go `testing/synctest` bubbles; Trio `MockClock(autojump_threshold=0)`; Effect `TestClock`.
