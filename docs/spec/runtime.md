# Runtime rules

The runtime gives Effect's guarantees on Go's scheduler: structured tasks, cooperative interruption, release that always completes, and typed exits. Go supplies goroutines, the garbage collector and preemption; Ergo adds no scheduler of its own. Definitions are in the [glossary](../../GLOSSARY.md).

Status summary: the prototype's runtime (`prototypes/sketch9/sketch/rt`) implements the task tree, stop propagation, the stop check before each capability call, `timeout.After` and defect propagation. `runtime/v1` implements the Go bodies of the std packages `task`, `scope` and `queue` over `runtime/rt` ([Tasks](#tasks), [Exit actions](#exit-actions), [Queues](#queues)); their Ergo signatures and their lowering are lower-v1 stage 3b, so a program that imports them is still refused with S109. Every other rule here is **designed, not yet implemented**.

## Tasks

Status: the task tree is **implemented in prototype**. The bodies of `task.Go`, `Wait` and `Stop` are **implemented** in `runtime/v1` (rules 7 to 12); their use from source is lower-v1 stage 3b.

1. **Tree.** Every task has a parent, except the task that runs `main`. Stopping a task stops every task below it. A child that finishes detaches from its parent.
2. **Starting.** `task.Go() { … }` starts a task and yields a `Task[T, E]`. `T` is the body's value and `E` its error row.
3. **Resource.** A `Task` is a resource ([resources.md](resources.md)). Its owner scope stops and drains it at scope end if it was not consumed. A `Task` can move by `return`, into a provider field, into another task or into a container ([resources.md](resources.md#moves)). In v1 only a direct `return` moves it (rule 8); a `Task` stored in a field, a container, a capture that outlives its frame or a generic value is refused with a located diagnostic until [#197](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/197) designs aggregate ownership. A queue of tasks is an error in v0 (README Gap 30).
4. **Consuming.** `t.Wait()` waits for the task and returns `T` or fails with `E`; a defect of the task re-raises in the waiter. `t.Stop()` interrupts the task and waits for it to finish, including its releases. Each consumes the task.
5. **Containers.** Not in v1 (rule 3). Tasks may live in a slice or map; the container is then a resource ([resources.md](resources.md#containers)). Indexing lends a task, so `running[j].Wait()` is an error. `running.Take(j)` moves a task out of the map before its fallible `Wait`, so a drain cannot run it twice.
6. **Captures.** The block of `task.Go` may not assign captured locals. Values copy into a task. A resource is lent to the task under the structured-lend rule, and moved into it otherwise ([resources.md](resources.md#structured-lend)). Only synchronised handles are shared: queues ([Queues](#queues)), `sync.Ref`, `sync.TxRef` and actor handles. *Prior art:* Swift `Sendable`; Go shares memory freely and relies on the race detector.

*Prior art:* Go `errgroup` is function-scoped in the same way; Effect fibers are forked into a scope; Elixir `Task.async` links the task to its caller, and `Task.shutdown` keeps the abnormal exit, as `Stop` keeps a defect here.

The runtime contract of `runtime/v1` (task.go), which the lowering of stage 3b binds:

7. **Start.** `task.Go() { … }` starts its block on a new goroutine, as a child of the task that runs the calling function, and returns the `Task` at once; the block runs later (parse-v1 ruling 5). The child starts interruptible, even inside an exit action. There the exit action's block owns it (rule 8), and the stop of the ending function does not cascade into it, so the cleanup completes; the block's own drain still stops it. Each task carries its Ergo identity, the block's definition and source site, which a defect's task chain names ([G2](#g2-fork-tree-defects)). *Prior art:* Go `go` and `errgroup.Go`; Effect 4 `Effect.fork` is interruptible unless asked to inherit; Kotlin `launch` in a `coroutineScope`.
8. **Owner.** The function that called `task.Go` owns the `Task`; a function literal and the block of `task.Go` are functions here, as for [exit actions](#exit-actions). The block of an exit action owns the tasks started in it: they are drained when the block ends ([Exit actions](#exit-actions) 5). When the owner returns, on any path, without `Wait` or `Stop`, it stops the task and waits until it has ended, its exit actions included. The owner's exit actions and its tasks form one last-in-first-out list: a task started after an exit action is drained before that action runs (law R2, structured lend). **Return (v1).** A `Task` leaves its function only by a direct `return`, which transfers it to the caller's frame in one step. A function whose result holds a `Task` receives its caller's frame scope as a hidden destination argument, as `Push` and `Pop` will receive the hidden task ([#199](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/199)), and its return moves the `Task` into that frame (`runtime/v1`: `return c.Move(dest)`; the lowering of stage 3b passes the destination and places the move). The caller's frame then owns the `Task`: the caller can `Wait` for it or `Stop` it, and its frame drains it when the caller returns. A call inside an exit action passes the action's frame. A `Task` never belongs to no frame, nor to a frame that cannot reach it. Ownership is one removable entry: a transfer moves it from the old frame to the new one, and `Wait`, `Stop` and a drain remove it, so a frame holds only the tasks it still owns, never the history of transfers. A `Task` that left its function without the move was drained when the function returned, and a later `Wait` is a defect that names the missing move: a guard of the lowering's calling convention, not an outcome of admitted source. *Prior art:* Rust moves a value to the caller on return, but a dropped tokio `JoinHandle` detaches its task, which Ergo does not take: the receiving frame drains it; Effect `forkIn` picks the scope at fork time, and removes the fiber's finalizer from it when the fiber completes; Trio passes the nursery to the function that starts tasks in it; a Go goroutine has no handle and no owner. *Prior art:* Trio nurseries and Swift task groups end their children before the scope; Kotlin `coroutineScope`; Go `errgroup.Wait` is explicit.
9. **Wait.** `t.Wait()` returns the task's value, or its typed failure when that failure is the task's whole exit, so a `catch` can handle it (law R6). Any other exit is raised in the waiter: a defect, with the task chain and the Go stack at the panic, and an interruption. `Wait` is an interruption point of the waiter: when the waiter is stopped first or while it waits, the task is stopped and drained, and the waiter's exit is the interruption with the task's defects; neither the task's value nor its typed failure is delivered (law R4). A second `Wait`, or a `Wait` after `Stop`, is a defect. *Prior art:* Effect `Fiber.join` re-raises the fiber's cause, interruption included; Elixir `Task.await` exits the caller with the task's exit; Go `errgroup.Wait` returns only the first error.
10. **Stop.** `t.Stop()` is rule 4: it returns only after the task's exit actions ran (law R5). The task's interruption and an abandoned typed failure are the expected result of the stop and are dropped (laws R3, R6); its defects are raised in the caller. A `Stop` after `Wait` or `Stop` does nothing. *Prior art:* Effect `Fiber.interrupt` waits for the fiber's finalizers; Elixir `Task.shutdown`.
11. **One waiter.** A `Task` belongs to the task that started it: only that task waits for it, stops it or returns it. Starting a task on a function that has returned is a defect (law R9), and so is a transfer into a frame that has returned, into a frame of another task or to no frame. Not yet: a move into another task is #197's.
12. **Not yet: an unobserved failure at a normal return.** When the owner returns normally while an unconsumed task has already ended with a typed failure, the failure is dropped. Law R3 keeps it; `runtime/rt` drops it (#198 handover O1). #197 makes a dropped `Task` a compile error, which removes this case from checked programs.

## I1. Interruption points

Status: **implemented in prototype** for capability calls; **designed, not yet implemented** for the rest.

1. Interruption is cooperative. A stopped task stops at its next interruption point.
2. The compiler inserts an interruption point before each capability call, queue operation, `Wait` and `Sleep`, and at each loop back-edge, in every function whose footprint is not empty ([rows.md](rows.md#footprints)).
3. An interruption point is one atomic load. When the task is stopped, the function exits with interruption ([Exit causes](#exit-causes)).
4. A loop with an empty footprint has no interruption point. Such a loop cannot be stopped until it ends, as with Effect on JavaScript. Go preemption keeps the scheduler fair but does not stop the loop.
5. A blocking runtime primitive waits for either its event or the stop, so a stopped task never stays parked.

*Prior art:* the `select` on `ctx.Done()` Go programmers write by hand; Effect checks interruption between steps; BEAM processes are preempted and can be killed outright, which Ergo does not do.

## I2. Automatic masks

Status: **designed, not yet implemented**.

These run uninterruptibly, to completion:

1. a resource release and a generated or written `Close` ([resources.md](resources.md));
2. a `scope.OnExit` body;
3. wire cleanup at the end of a `with`;
4. the step between a successful acquisition and its registration for release.

If an acquisition succeeds, its release runs. A blocking primitive inside a masked region waits uninterruptibly, unless it is explicitly marked as an interruptible wait in the mask (the `poll` pattern). Masks nest; an inner region restores the outer mask state, never an unmasked one. *Prior art:* Cats Effect `MonadCancel.bracket` and `uncancelable` with `poll`; Effect `acquireRelease` and `uninterruptibleMask`.

## Exit causes

Status: **partly implemented in prototype**.

1. A task ends with one exit: a success value, or a cause. A cause holds one or more of: a typed failure from the error row, a defect, and an interruption.
2. **Interruption is not a typed error.** No error row names it, and every `catch` passes it on ([rows.md](rows.md#catch)). In a function with no error row, interruption still propagates as part of the exit, not through the row (README Gap 2). Prototype: such a function panics with `rt.Interrupted`, and the nearest task boundary recovers it.
3. **Defects.** A Go panic in Ergo code is a defect. A defect in a child re-raises in the parent at the join, on every path, including the timeout and stop paths. Prototype: implemented for `timeout.After`.
4. **Release defects.** A defect or an interruption during a release joins the cause beside the body's outcome. No cause is dropped.
5. **Stop wins.** When a task is stopped while its body runs, interruption wins over the body's success.
6. **Entry.** When `main`'s exit is a cause, the program prints each reason and exits with status 2 when any reason is a defect, 130 when every reason is an interruption, and 1 otherwise. Prototype: an interruption that reaches `main` exits 130; a defect prints `defect: …` and exits 2. The entry of `runtime/v1`, `Main`, runs `main` as the root task and writes one report per reason on standard error: `error: VALUE` for a typed failure, `panic: VALUE` for a defect, followed by the task chain when the defect began below `main` and by the Go stack at the panic, and `interrupted`. It exits with status 2 when any reason is a defect, as Go's own panic report does, 130 when every reason is an interruption, and 1 otherwise.
7. **How exits cross lowered code.** A lowered function returns a typed failure as its last Go result, and nothing else travels that way. An interruption, an exit already recorded at a boundary, and a fresh defect travel as Go panics, so no `catch`, which is a Go type switch over returned errors, can handle one (rule 2; [rows.md](rows.md#catch), catch rule 6). A boundary (a task's block, the end of a function that owns tasks or exit actions, an exit action, `Main`) recovers the panic and records it; a fresh defect is recorded with the Go stack at the panic, so the `//line` anchor of the faulting `.ergo` line survives the crossing of tasks and functions. *Prior art:* Effect keeps failures in the error channel and defects and interruptions in the `Cause`; Elixir separates `rescue`, `throw` and `exit`; Go returns errors and panics for the rest.

## Exit actions

Status: the runtime body is **implemented** in `runtime/v1` (`Scope.OnExit`, rule 5); its use from source is lower-v1 stage 3b.

1. `scope.OnExit() { … }` registers its block on the innermost enclosing function. The block runs when that function returns, on every path, and the blocks one call registered run last registered first. This is Go's `defer`, exactly. Each block runs masked ([I2](#i2-automatic-masks)).
2. A function declaration, a function literal and the block of `task.Go` are functions here: an OnExit in a task's block runs when the task ends. The block of an exit action is one too, as a deferred function literal is in Go: an OnExit in it runs when the block ends, and a task started in it is drained then (rule 5). A `with` block, an `if` or `match` arm and a loop body are not: an OnExit inside them registers on the enclosing function, and one inside a loop registers once per iteration. Whether the block of another call (`timeout.After`, `sync.Atomically`) counts as a function is not decided here.
3. Cleanup at the end of a `with` block is a resource's release, not an OnExit: a resource bound in the block is released when the block ends ([resources.md](resources.md)).
4. The block reads its variables when it runs. Go evaluates a `defer` call's arguments at the `defer` statement instead, so `scripts/migrate196` rewrites `defer f(x)` only when `f` is a function name, each argument is a literal or a local that nothing writes, and the `defer` stands at the top level of a function body; any other `defer` is a hand edit.
5. **What the runtime adds to `defer`.** `scope.OnExit` is a direct call (an extern function is call-only), so the lowering always knows its frame. It gives each function that registers an exit action or starts a task one frame scope, ends that scope with the function's first Go `defer`, and registers each block on it. Go's `defer` alone gives the timing of rules 1, 2 and 4. The frame scope adds what `defer` cannot give:
   - the block runs masked ([I2](#i2-automatic-masks));
   - a defect in a block joins the function's exit beside its earlier reasons ([Exit causes](#exit-causes) 4). With Go's `defer`, a panic in a deferred call replaces the panic already in flight, and drops a typed failure the function already returned;
   - the blocks and the function's tasks are one last-in-first-out list, so a task started after a block is stopped and drained before the block runs (law R2; [Tasks](#tasks) rule 8). Separate Go `defer`s would run every block first, then drain the tasks;
   - while a block runs, it is a frame of its own: a task it starts (`task.Go`, [Tasks](#tasks) rule 8) and an exit action it registers belong to it, and they end when the block ends, before the next block of the function runs. The route to the block's frame lasts through the block and through its frame's own release, so an exit action that the block registers is itself a frame for what it starts, at any depth. So a cleanup can start a task and `Wait` for it.

*Prior art:* Go's `defer` is function-scoped, and Ergo takes it because Go is the target, so the lowering and the translation are exact. Swift and Zig `defer` run at the end of the enclosing block. Effect `Scope.addFinalizer` and `Effect.onExit` run finalizers uninterruptibly and keep every finalizer's failure in the `Cause`; Go `errgroup` and Trio nurseries join children before the scope's own cleanup.

## Timeouts

Status: **implemented in prototype** as a name-keyed exception (README Gap 31); **designed** as the library function below.

```go
let payment = try timeout.After(500ms) { Gateway.Authorize(order) }
```

**Classification.** `timeout.After` is an ordinary library function in the `timeout` package, not a construct. Under the owner's rules, constructs get keywords, a dot form is library, and kernel primitives are functions (owner, 2026-10-12). Its kernel primitives are task start (`task.Go`), `Task.Stop` and `Task.Wait`, and the `Scheduler` capability. Its designed signature, in the generic spelling of [types.md](types.md#generics):

```go
func After[T, E, R](d duration, body func() T fails E needs R) T fails E | Expired needs Scheduler, R {
	// designed: the body runs as a child task raced against the deadline
}
```

The callback type carries `needs R`, so the requirements of the block appear in `After`'s own row. A trailing block is the `body` argument ([grammar.md](grammar.md#expressions)). *Prior art:* Effect's `Effect.timeout` is an ordinary combinator over fibers and the clock; Go's `context.WithTimeout` is a library function.

1. `timeout.After(d) { block }` needs `import "timeout"`. It takes one `duration` (S108) and a block (S108). The duration is a value position, so a fallible duration is S105.
2. It charges `Scheduler` and the block's requirements ([rows.md](rows.md#capability-rows)), because its signature says so.
3. Its block is a function literal and so a failure target: a `try` in the block escapes into the `timeout.After` expression, not into the enclosing function. The expression's error row is `timeout.Expired`, plus the block's last expression's row, plus every error a `try` in the block escapes, which is `E | Expired` in the signature.
4. The block runs as a child task. If the deadline passes first, the child is stopped and drained, and the expression fails with `timeout.Expired`. The result comes only after the child has finished, so completed cleanup beats deadline punctuality (NORTH_STAR tiebreak).
5. If the parent is stopped first, or while the block runs, the child is stopped and drained, and the expression's exit is an interruption.
6. A defect in the child re-raises in the parent on every path.
7. The block ends with an expression, and it may not contain `return` ([grammar.md](grammar.md#expressions), trailing-block rule; S109 in the prototype). Write an explicit `func` literal to return early.
8. **Lowering.** The block is the only Go func literal the prototype emits: the child task's body.

*Prior art:* Effect `Effect.timeout`; Go `context.WithTimeout`, which cancels but does not wait for the work to stop; Elixir `Task.yield` followed by `Task.shutdown`.

## Observability and supervision

Status: **designed, not yet implemented** ([#69](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/69), [#200](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/200), [#207](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/207)).

### G1. Context through `with`

1. `with` takes context values as well as wires: `with trace.Span("ingest"), log.Annotate("region", "eu") { … }`.
2. A context value is immutable. Every task started inside the block inherits it. A restarted task inherits the values its factory captured.
3. *Prior art:* Java `ScopedValue`; Effect `References`; Go `context.WithValue`, which has to be threaded by hand.

### G2. Fork-tree defects

1. Each task records its parent, its span and its start site.
2. A defect prints the chain of tasks and spans that led to it, from the failing task to the root:

   ```text
   defect: index out of range [3] with length 3
     at handle (ingest.ergo:31)
     task #7 handle, started by tasks.Set #2 at main (ingest.ergo:24)
       span ingest  region=eu  peer=10.0.0.4
     task #1 main
   ```

3. Ancestry retention is bounded.

### G3. `ergo ps <pid>`

1. `ergo ps <pid>` shows the live task tree of a running program: each task's state, what it waits on, its span and its restarts.
2. It is served over a debug endpoint, for people and agents, with the same schema in CLI and MCP.
3. Spans are keyed to checked definition identities ([#188](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/188)), so a trace line links to the source definition and to `ergo inspect`.

### G4. `tasks.Set`

1. `tasks.Set(policy)` owns an unbounded number of tasks and drops finished ones. It is a resource: the block that acquired it owns it, or the scope it moved to, such as a provider ([resources.md](resources.md) R4); its owner scope releases it when that scope ends (R5).
2. The policy is fail-fast, `tasks.LogFailures`, or restart with a `schedule`: `tasks.Restart(schedule.Exponential(1s).UpTo(5))`.
3. `Set.Go` takes a `func` literal, because the Set keeps it after `Go` returns. The literal escapes, so it may capture a resource only under the structured-lend rule: the Set must be released before the borrow of the resource ends ([resources.md](resources.md#closures)). In `set.Go(func() { actor.Pump(b, signals) })`, when `set` and `b` are bound in the same scope, `set` must be declared after `b`. Other owner arrangements follow R27 and R31: for example, a `set` bound inside a `with` block nested in `b`'s scope is released first and qualifies. In every arrangement, `b.Stop()` while `set` may still run the literal is an error.
4. A restart policy needs a reusable factory that captures no moved resource. A connection moved into its handler cannot restart, so such a Set uses `tasks.LogFailures`.
5. *Prior art:* Erlang/OTP `one_for_one` supervisors restart from the child specification; Effect `FiberSet` and `Supervisor`; Go has neither.

<a id="channels"></a>

## Queues

Status: the runtime body is **implemented** in `runtime/v1` (queue.go); the signatures of the std package `queue` and their lowering are lower-v1 stage 3b ([#207](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/207), [#64](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/64)).

Ergo has no channels (parse-v1 ruling 3): `chan` and `select` are reserved words, and there are no nil queues and no direction types. A `queue.Queue[T]` is a first-in-first-out list of values between tasks, with a fixed capacity. Its operations are `queue.New[T](capacity)`, `q.Push(v)`, which fails with `queue.Closed`, `q.Pop()`, which returns `T` or fails with `queue.Closed`, `q.Values()` and `q.Close()`.

1. **New.** `queue.New[T](capacity)` makes an open, empty queue. The capacity is how many values the queue holds that no `Pop` has taken yet. With capacity 0, each `Push` waits for the `Pop` that takes its value. A negative capacity is a defect. *Prior art:* Go `make(chan T, n)`, where 0 is unbuffered and a negative size panics; Kotlin `Channel(RENDEZVOUS)`; Effect `Queue.bounded(n)`.
2. **Push.** `q.Push(v)` adds `v` at the back. While the queue is full, `Push` waits (backpressure). Pushes that wait enter in the order they began to wait. *Prior art:* a Go send on a full channel waits, and Go serves waiting senders in order; Effect's bounded `Queue.offer` suspends; Rust `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender::send` waits for capacity.
3. **Pop.** `q.Pop()` takes the value at the front, and waits while the queue is open and empty. It returns `T` or fails with `queue.Closed` (rule 5), so it never invents a value ([types.md](types.md#zero-values-and-definite-initialisation) rule 4). *Prior art:* Go receive; Effect `Queue.take`; Kotlin `receive`.
4. **Close.** `q.Close()` ends admission. It does nothing on a closed queue, never waits and never fails. The values already in the queue stay for `Pop` and `Values`. *Prior art:* Effect `Queue.shutdown` and Kotlin `close` may be called again; Go panics on a second `close`.
5. **After Close: `queue.Closed`.** A `Push` on a closed queue, and a `Push` that still waits when the queue closes, fail with the typed failure `queue.Closed`, and the value never enters the queue. A `Pop` on a closed queue takes each value that entered before the close; a `Pop` on a closed, empty queue fails with `queue.Closed`, because it has no value to return. A closed queue is a normal end of the protocol, not a stop: `queue.Closed` is in the error row of `Push` and `Pop`, so a public contract names it and a `catch` handles it, as `actor.Stopped` is for `Send` and `Ask` after `Stop` ([Machines and actors](#machines-and-actors)). An interruption stays the result of a stop from outside ([Exit causes](#exit-causes) 2). *Prior art:* tokio `mpsc`: `send` returns `SendError` and `recv` returns `None`; Kotlin throws `ClosedSendChannelException` on a send and `ClosedReceiveChannelException` on a receive after the drain; Go gives `v, ok` on a receive, but panics on a send to a closed channel, which Ergo does not take: when several producers share a queue, a send after the close is not a programmer error. Effect 3 `Queue.shutdown` interrupts every waiting and later `offer` and `take`, which Ergo does not take either: it would make a closed queue look like a stop.
6. **Values.** `q.Values()` returns `Seq[T]`, which the lowering represents as Go's `iter.Seq[T]` (lower-v1 Q1). Each step is a `Pop`, so `for v in q.Values()` drains the queue in FIFO order, and it ends normally, with no failure, when the queue is closed and empty. A loop that stops early (`break`, `return`, `try`) takes no more values; the rest stay in the queue. *Prior art:* Go's `for v := range ch` ends at `close`; an `iter.Seq` stops when `yield` returns false; Elixir `Enumerable` halts; GenStage consumers take only what they ask for.
7. **Delivery.** Every value whose `Push` succeeded is taken exactly once, by one `Pop` or one step of `Values`, in the order the values entered. A value whose `Push` failed with `queue.Closed` is never taken. Several tasks may push, pop and iterate one queue at the same time; the order in which waiting `Pop`s are served is not specified. Values copy into a queue; a queue whose element type is a resource is an error in v0 ([resources.md](resources.md#channels); README Gap 30). *Prior art:* Go channels; Effect `Queue`; tokio `mpsc`.
8. **Not yet: a stop does not reach a waiting Push or Pop ([#199](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/199)).** By design, `Push`, `Pop` and each step of `Values` are interruption points ([I1](#i1-interruption-points)). In v1, the queue's operations take no task, so that the runtime value is the operations value the lowering emits; a task that is stopped while it waits in `Push` or `Pop` keeps waiting until the queue changes (a `Pop`, a `Push` or a `Close`). `Close` wakes every waiter. So a function that stops a producer blocked on a full queue that nobody drains waits until something closes the queue. #199 threads the task to these waits. *Prior art:* Kotlin channels and tokio wake a cancelled waiter; in Go the waiter needs its own `select` on `ctx.Done()`.

## Runtime laws for task, scope and queue

The laws of [docs/research/lawful-runtime-contract.md](../research/lawful-runtime-contract.md) ([#124](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/124), now in #199) that apply to `runtime/v1`'s bodies run as Go tests in `runtime/v1`, under `go test -race`. A passing finite suite is evidence, not proof.

| Law | What runs | Test | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | A function's exit actions run last registered first, a loop's once per iteration. | TestFrameReleaseOrder | tested |
| R2 | A function's end drains each unconsumed task, its exit actions included, before an action registered earlier; an exit action's block drains its own tasks before the next action runs. | TestFrameReleaseOrder, TestGoInExitAction | tested |
| R3 | When the owner ends with a failure, an abandoned task's typed failure is dropped and its defect kept. At a normal end, an unobserved typed failure is dropped. | TestAbandonedChild, TestGapR3NormalClose | partial: the normal end is the Tasks rule 12 gap |
| R4 | A completed `Wait` delivers the exit; an interrupted `Wait` delivers neither value nor typed failure. | TestWait, TestWaitInterrupted | tested |
| R5 | `Stop` and an interrupted `Wait` return after the task's exit actions. | TestStop, TestWaitInterrupted | tested |
| R6 | Every reason is kept (a failure with an action's defect, two defects); only a lone typed failure reaches a `catch`. | TestExitCauses, TestWait | tested |
| R7 | A `catch` runs in the failing function. | lowering (a Go type switch in that function) | not a runtime body |
| R8 | `timeout.After` | `runtime/rt` After; bound in stage 3b | not these modules |
| R9 | A function that has returned admits no task and no returned `Task`; nor does a frame of another task. A join from another task is not checked. | TestGoOnEndedFrame, TestTaskReturn | partial: Tasks rule 11 gap |
| R10 | A task is linked to its owner before it runs; every started task ends before its owner returns, and a returned task before the caller's frame does. A frame holds only the tasks it still owns. | TestNoTaskOutlivesItsFrame, TestTaskReturn, TestTaskRegistrationsBounded | tested |
| R11 | Making a value runs nothing. | `queue.New` and `task.Go` are direct calls in direct-style source | not applicable |
| R12, R13 | Provision and layer builds. | `with` and `wire` lowering | not these modules |

The queue contract runs as TestQueueContract (each rule above), TestQueueModel (300 seeded sequences against a model) and TestQueueInterleavings (300 seeded runs of producers, consumers by `Pop` and by `Values`, early stops and a `Close` at a random point; every delivered value is taken exactly once, no value whose `Push` failed is taken, and each producer's values keep their order), and TestQueueStress (the same checks with up to 6 producers, 6 consumers and 350 values each). TestNoTaskOutlivesItsFrame, TestQueueInterleavings and TestQueueStress also check that no goroutine is left.

## Machines and actors

Status: **designed, not yet implemented** ([#57](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/57)).

```go
type State = Closed | Open | HalfOpen
type Signal = Failure | Success | Retry

func step(s State, sig Signal) Decision[State, string] fails ProbeDown needs Probe {
	match (s, sig) {
	case (Closed, Failure):
		return Enter{Open{sig.Endpoint}}
	case (HalfOpen, Success):
		return Enter{Closed{0}}
	case (_, _):
		return Ignore{}
	}
}

type Breaker machine[State, Signal] {
	initial: Closed{0},
	step:    step,
}
```

1. **Machine.** `type X machine[S, E] { initial v; step f }` declares a state machine. `S` and `E` are unions. `initial` is a value of `S`; `step` names a function from `S` and `E` to `Decision[S, O]`, with any error and `needs` rows.
2. **Decision.** A step returns `Enter{next}` (re-enter, even with the same variant), `Stay{next}` (keep the entry), `Ignore{}`, `Reject{}` (observable, state unchanged) or `Done{output}` (terminal).
3. **Totality.** The step's switch is total over `S × E` (README Gap 12).
4. **Inspection.** `ergo inspect` draws the machine's graph from the step's cases. A helper the step calls is static in the graph only when its footprint is empty, not its row ([rows.md](rows.md#footprints)).
5. **Protocol.** A machine is a plan that any lawful provider can run; the actor below is the standard library's provider. *Prior art:* XState machines with interpreters; Erlang `gen_statem`.
6. **Actors are library code** (owner, 2026-10-27: "Let's see if we can make actor a library mechanism"; [#101](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/101); [research note](../research/actor-library.md)). The `actor` package is ordinary code over generics, unions, function types with rows, resources and tasks. No compiler rule names it, and it has no syntax.
   - `actor.Start(initial, capacity, handle)` runs `handle func(S, M) actor.Next[S] fails E needs R` over a mailbox of `capacity` messages and returns an `actor.Actor[M, E]`. It charges `R`, which the actor captures. A handler failure ends the actor.
   - A message that wants an answer carries an `actor.Reply[T, E]`. `actor.Ask(to, request)` builds the message around a fresh reply and returns `T` or fails with `E | actor.Stopped | actor.NoReply`. `T` and `E` come from `request`'s parameter type, so a wrong reply type is a type error.
   - `Reply[T, E]` is a resource. `Send` and `Fail` consume it. Releasing it unanswered answers `NoReply` while the actor runs, and `Stopped` once its stop is requested. An answer nobody can receive, because the asker was stopped and detached, is released exactly once (README Gap 37); an answer or failure the library releases is released masked, by its kind, and a refusal releases nothing. A successful result discarded by stop-wins after the handoff (an answer taken just before the asker's task stops, a callback result discarded by a scope's stop) needs README Gap 47.
   - A message, a reply, an agent result and a state snapshot cross a task boundary, so each is a copy that shares no mutable storage with the sender's value (Tasks rule 6; README Gap 45). A resource moves.
   - `Send` waits only while the mailbox is full. Messages are handled in admission order.
   - `Stop` closes admission, then interrupts the actor and waits until it ends. After the stop is requested, no `Send` or `Ask` is admitted: each fails with `actor.Stopped`. Queued requests are answered `Stopped`, every queued message and then the state is released, and every release runs even when an earlier one panics. It returns the typed failure that ended the actor, if any, and every defect in order.
   - `actor.StartMachine(m, capacity)` runs a machine value `m Machine[S, E, O, F, R]` (README Gap 46) with `Send`, `Ask`, `State` and `Stop`. `Ask` returns the step's `Decision[S, O]` or the step's failure. `State` returns a snapshot, never a shared reference. A step failure goes to the asker; a step failure after a `Send` ends the actor, because it has no other observer.
   - `actor.StartAgent(initial, capacity)` and `actor.Call(a, f)` serve calls on a state value. The protocol is the functions whose first parameter is `*S`. `f func(r *S) T fails E` borrows the state for one call, and the borrow cannot escape ([types.md](types.md#borrows) Borrows rules 1 and 4; R17, R30, R33). `f` has an empty `needs` row, which is not purity: `f` runs on the actor's task, so a wait inside it is an interruption point (I1) that `Stop` interrupts. A typed failure of `f` is the caller's; an interruption or a defect ends the agent, and the agent releases its state.
   - `actor.Run` runs a machine under a `tasks.Set` for supervision; a restart starts from `initial`.
7. **Owner and address (resolved 2026-10-27).** `actor.Actor[M, E]` holds the actor's task, so it is a resource (R1, R14): its owner scope stops it at scope end, and `Stop` consumes it. `actor.Address[M]`, from `a.Address()`, holds only synchronised handles, so it copies into tasks and is not a resource. After the actor ends, `Send` and `Ask` on an address fail with `actor.Stopped`. The rules these items need from the checker and the linearity pass are README Gaps 35 to 47.

*Prior art:* Erlang/OTP `gen_server` and `gen_statem`; Gleam OTP `process.call` with a typed reply subject in the message, and Akka Typed `ask` with `replyTo`, which `actor.Ask` follows; Tokio's `oneshot::Sender`, whose drop answers the receiver as a released `Reply` does; Elixir `Agent` for `actor.Call`; Effect cluster entities. Swift and Pony give actors syntax to check shared mutable state; Ergo's actor state is a value owned by the actor's task, so it needs none.

## Host and lowering notes

These notes are not normative; they record the lowering of `internal/sketch/lower` (lower-v1), which a later compiler may change while keeping the rules above. `ergo build` and `ergo run` lower from the checker's `Info` alone; no second checker or emitter runs.

- **Module layout.** A program is one Go module, `ergo.local/program`, with `main.go` and the runtime support `runtime/v1` copied beside it under `ergo/` and named by a `replace` directive, so a build downloads nothing and the emission cache key covers the runtime bytes.
- **Capabilities.** A function whose checked capability row is not empty takes a hidden first parameter, a pointer to one `Env` struct with one field per capability of the package. A function with an empty row takes none. A caller with no environment passes one shared empty `Env`, never nil, so a `with` inside the callee copies it. `main` builds the `Env` from the host providers its row names (today `Console`); a host capability it cannot provide is refused at build (S109). A `with` block copies the `Env`, sets the fields its wire binds and passes the copy's address on; a wire is a generated builder function that evaluates each entry it keeps once, in dependency order, and never builds an overridden entry.
- **Rows.** A function with a non-empty error row returns Go `error` last. A typed failure is the error type's value, a Go struct with an `Error` method; `try` returns it on; `catch` is a Go type switch, whose missing arms re-return the value for a partial catch. `main`'s remaining failure prints `error: VALUE` on standard error and exits with status 1. An error type's text is its name and its fields, written by a generated function per type: `Bad{at:{code:7} ok:true tags:[a b]}`. No user function (a 196m `String` or `Error`) takes part; an operation value writes `<Type>`, a function value `<func>`. An error type with a field whose type has a type parameter is refused at build (S109, lower-v1 stage 3).
- **Defects.** A defect is an ordinary Go panic (an index out of range, an integer division by zero). No catch handles it. In a program with no task and no exit action nothing recovers it, and Go's report, with exit status 2, names the `.ergo` line through the directives below. The bodies of `task` and `scope` record it at a task or function boundary with the Go stack at the panic, and `Main` prints that stack ([Exit causes](#exit-causes) 6 and 7), so the line survives.- **Order.** Operands run left to right, each once; an operand a later operand could change is bound to a temporary first. An assignment fixes its place first: the pointer, slice and index that pick it are bound before the value runs. A place is a variable, `*p`, a field or an element, nested in any order. A `*T` function called on a `T` place takes the place's address where the receiver stands, never a copy.
- **Names.** Every package-scope Go name (declarations, reached library declarations, wire builders, adapters, text functions, imports, `Env`) is given by a naming pass over the declarations and the checker's Info before any body is lowered; it lowers no body, and lowering runs once. Every local, in user functions and in generated helpers alike, comes from a scope whose parent holds those names, so neither captures the other. A source name keeps its spelling unless Go reserves it.
- **Extern bodies.** A Go body is bound to the prelude declaration it implements (today `Sleep` of `LiveScheduler`), never to the extern's target text; a user extern with the same target is refused at its declaration until check-v1 stage E. Two match arms with one value in their type are refused at the second arm, so Go never sees a duplicate case.
- **Values.** Records are named structs; a union is a sealed interface with an unexported marker method; a 196m same-name function on a local record type is a Go method. An operations value is a Go interface; a record that does not have the exact methods passes through a generated adapter. Every function value has one Go shape, `func(*Env, params) (result, error)`, so a value of any row passes where a wider row is expected without a wrapper.
- **Not yet lowered.** Task handles and interruption points (no function takes a task handle, and the prototype's `rt.Recover` exit 130 is not emitted), exit actions, string interpolation, `for … in`, tuples, map indexing and the prelude's and std's extern bodies other than `Sleep` are refused at build with S109, naming the stage that adds them.
- Source positions are carried with `//line` directives, so Go panics, pprof, delve and the race detector point at Ergo lines. A directive names the source by its admitted absolute path. A path that a directive cannot name (a control character, invalid UTF-8, U+FEFF, or a path that is not absolute and clean) is refused before anything is emitted, because a line feed in it would end the directive and turn the rest of the name into Go code.
- **Emission cache ([#224](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/224)).** `ergo build` and `ergo run` emit each package's Go module into `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ergo/modules/KEY` (else `os.UserCacheDir()/ergo`; a relative `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is ignored for this root; the go command itself still needs `GOCACHE` then). `KEY` is the SHA-256 of a canonical summary of everything emission reads: the sorted source paths and bytes, the dependency summaries (until package summaries exist (196b), each bundled std package is summarised by a digest of all its source), the compiler's producer identity (`internal/producer`, the identity check envelopes report, acquired once, when the cache first needs the key): on Linux the SHA-256 of the executing file (`/proc/self/exe`); on darwin the SHA-256 of the executing image's authenticated code, the bytes below its code signature in the thin Mach-O at the executable's path, accepted only when the kernel's cdhash of the running image names a CodeDirectory of full SHA-256 page hashes and every page matches (a SHA-1 or truncated directory gives a process-scoped identity; two signed files with the same code and different signature data share the identity, by design), under the domain tag `ergo-producer-darwin-code-1` (the signature container and trailing bytes cannot change the running code and are not part of the key), so a compiler replaced during a build cannot key one compiler's output with another's digest, the emitter revision, the runtime files copied into the module, the fixed language revision, the build or test mode and the emission flags. The module's `ergo-manifest.json` states that summary, every output's digest and completion. Where no kernel record exists, or the darwin verification fails (the file was replaced), the identity is process-scoped (`process:` and a nonce): it never keys a published module. The module is built in the process's private root, `ergo/private/ID/modules/KEY`, reused only by that process, and never renamed into `modules`. A build holds a shared `flock` lease on the root from the moment it takes the root until its link ends, on every path, including a failed build; builds of one process share the lease and count their uses, so a long-lived host holds nothing between builds. A build starts a sweep of private roots at most once per 24 hours per cache: a stamp file, `ergo/private/.swept`, records when the last complete sweep ended, one process claims each pass by locking it (the kernel drops the claim if that process dies), and a build that finds the stamp recent reads only that file. A pass reads names in chunks, examines at most 1024 of them and removes at most 64 roots; a pass that hits a bound, or dies, leaves the sweep due with a cursor, so the next build continues it, and reclaim keeps pace with however many private roots builds create; it removes a root only when the root is older than 24 hours and the pass takes its lease exclusively without waiting, so no build holds it, and it renames the root aside before deleting it, so a build that arrives meanwhile makes a fresh root (where `flock` does not exist, private roots are never removed). A producer with no identity at all stops the build with its reason. A module is staged privately and published by one rename, so a partial module never satisfies a hit. A reused module is first verified against its manifest; an entry that does not verify is moved aside and replaced. A valid hit writes nothing. The go command then always links the module, and Go's action cache decides what to rebuild for the toolchain, `GOOS`, `GOARCH` and `GOFLAGS`. `ergo build -work` prints `WORK=DIR` on stderr, where `DIR` is the module. Limits: stale entries are not evicted, and a builder killed during staging leaves its staging directory behind. Any file added in `DIR`, such as the executable of a `go build` run there without `-o`, makes the entry fail verification, so the next build emits it again.
- *Prior art:* Ergo's earlier Go emitter built a closure per effect step and measured a 47.8 s `go build` for 1,024 sequential operations; direct calls rebuilt in 2.08 s in the same measurement. Gleam source maps and ReScript's readable output follow the same "erase to idiomatic host code" goal.
