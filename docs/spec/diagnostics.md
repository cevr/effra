# Diagnostics

Status: S001 is **implemented** by the parser `internal/sketch/syntax` ([#195](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/195)). The other codes are **implemented** by the checker `internal/sketch/check` ([#196](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/196)), which `ergo check` and `ergo diagnostics` run. The checker's code table (`internal/sketch/check/codes.go`) mirrors this page; a test keeps the table, the emitted codes and the rows below in step. `ergo build` and `ergo run` run the checker first, then lower through the prototype emitter (`internal/sketch/proto`) until [#50](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/50) lowers from the checker's output; a program the prototype cannot lower is refused at build with S109 naming #50, and nothing is written. The checker's fixtures are in `internal/sketch/check/testdata/fixtures`; the prototype's fixtures (first line `// want CODE`) keep their outcome except the changes [the parity table](../../internal/sketch/check/testdata/parity.overrides) lists. The main compiler maps each rule to a code in its EF registry ([#79](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/79); README Gap 18).

A diagnostic has a position, a code and a message: `file:line:col: CODE message`. A file with any diagnostic does not build. The checker reports every diagnostic, sorted by position; an invalid operand or type suppresses every diagnostic that would follow from it, so one mistake gives one diagnostic. Prototype fixture paths are relative to [`prototypes/sketch9/testdata`](../../prototypes/sketch9/testdata); checker fixture names are files in `internal/sketch/check/testdata/fixtures/negative`.

## Codes

| Code | Rule | Spec section | Fixture example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S001 | Source text must lex and parse: valid identifiers, terminated strings, known number suffixes, no Go form outside the language, no mixed keyed and positional literal. | [grammar](grammar.md) | `probes/nonletter-name.ergo` |
| S101 | Every error that can escape a function must be in its declared `fails` row. | [rows: error rows](rows.md#error-rows) | `reject/undeclared-error.ergo` |
| S102 | Every capability a body charges must be in its capability row or discharged by an enclosing `with`. | [rows: capability rows](rows.md#capability-rows) | `reject/missing-capability.ergo` |
| S103 | Totality: a `catch` without `try` must handle every error in the caught row, and a `match` over unions must name every variant (or tuple of variants) or have `case _`. | [rows: catch](rows.md#catch), [rows: totality](rows.md#totality) | `reject/catch-not-total.ergo`, `type-switch-not-total` |
| S104 | Every name must resolve, in the role its position gives it: locals, functions, types, fields, methods, capabilities, wires and error types. | [types](types.md), [rows](rows.md) | `reject/unknown-name.ergo` |
| S105 | A fallible expression must be tried, caught or returned; it cannot stand in a value position. | [rows: error rows](rows.md#error-rows) | `probes/composite-error.ergo` |
| S106 | A wire provider must implement its capability, with the same signatures and no wider error row. | [rows: wire](rows.md#wire) | `probes/provider-parameter.ergo` |
| S107 | A function with a result must not reach the end of its body. | [rows: totality](rows.md#totality) | `missing-return` |
| S108 | Types and declarations must be used consistently: no type mismatch, duplicate declaration, invalid literal, unsatisfied constraint, kind conflict, wire cycle or misuse of a construct. | [types](types.md), [rows](rows.md) | `probes/duplicate-field.ergo` |
| S109 | A construct another ticket owns is refused, naming that ticket; at build only, a program the prototype emitter cannot lower. | README Gaps 6 and 33, [runtime: G1](runtime.md) | `wire-constructor-is-37` |
| S110 | A declared local, binding or import must be read, and an expression statement must be a call, a receive, `try` or `catch`, as in Go. | [grammar: statements](grammar.md#statements) | `probes/unused-expression.ergo` |
| S111 | A wire must not have two entries for one capability, except a `replace` of an embedded entry. | [rows: wire](rows.md#wire), README Gap 28 | `duplicate-wire-entry` |
| S112 (designed) | A map's key type must not be a resource in v0. | [resources: containers](resources.md#containers), README Gap 32 | none yet: negative example `Map[Key, string]{openKey(): "v"}` in resources.md |
| S113 | The entry function `main` takes no parameters, returns no value (an error row is allowed) and is not called. | [rows: capability rows](rows.md#capability-rows), README Gap 4 | `main-parameter`, `main-called`, `main-value-result` |

Designed codes are not emitted yet. Other designed errors in `docs/spec/` (resources, escape, exclusivity, channels of resources) get codes when [#197](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/197) implements them; construction authority (types.md Zero values 6) gets S114 with packages (#196, second part).

## Rules by code

Each rule names a fixture where one exists.

### S001: syntax

The parser `internal/sketch/syntax` ([#196](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/196)) reports S001 with a specific message ("expected X, found Y"), a byte offset and length, a line and a byte column. It reports the first error only. The formatter refuses a file with S001 on every surface, naming the code and position.

- An identifier is tested on decoded code points; a code point that cannot start or continue it, or invalid UTF-8, is S001 (`probes/nonletter-name.ergo`).
- A composite literal mixes keyed and positional elements (`probes/mixed-fields.ergo`).
- A Go habit outside the decided grammar: the message names the Ergo form, as `x := e` names `let x = e` and `defer f()` names `scope.OnExit` ([grammar: Old spellings](grammar.md#old-spellings) holds the whole table).
- An old Ergo-only spelling (`error[…]` rows, `wire Name { A = x }`, `catch e { … }`, `uses`, `try` in operand position): the plain S001, with no rename hint (#217).
- A keyword or reserved word used as a name (`let match = 1`), and a word that is not in the language (`enum`) where a declaration or statement starts.
- A wire value with `needs` before `provides`.
- A form the decided grammar does not admit: a local type declaration, a `~` constraint, a type parameter list on an operation, a trailing block without the call's parentheses (`task.Go { … }`), a statement-leading `if`, `match` or `for` continued by an operator, selector or call, `case limit + 1:` (a case lists patterns), a type that is not a type name in a `fails` row or a union (`fails []int`, `type U = []int | B`).
- A malformed construct: an unknown or duplicate machine entry, a machine without `step`, `needs (A, B)` on a declaration.
- An unterminated string or block comment, a newline inside an interpreted string, an unknown number suffix (`5kg`), an unexpected character, an import after a declaration.
- A tree higher than 1000 levels, in any composition of chains, operators, parentheses, types, statements and blocks ([grammar](grammar.md#parser) rule 5).

A type that mixes fields with operations or laws is S108 from the parser ([grammar](grammar.md#declarations) rule 5). The fixtures are `sketchtest.MalformedTable` (`TestMalformed`) and `testdata/refuse` (`TestRefusedFixtures`) in `internal/sketch/syntax`.

### S101: undeclared error

- An error escapes through `try` and is not in the declared row (`reject/undeclared-error.ergo`, `undeclared-error`).
- A function returns a value of an error type, a type named in an error row of its package, and its row does not list it (`probes/error-as-value.ergo`).
- A partial `try … catch` leaves an undeclared error (`partial-catch-rest`).
- An inline wire's provider expression can fail, and the enclosing function does not declare it (`probes/wire-initializer-error.ergo`).
- A named wire's provider can fail while it is built: a named wire is closed (`probes/named-wire-failure.ergo`; README Gap 6).
- The step of an exported machine type spells its rows (the export guard), so an error it does not list is S101 (`export-guard-machine-step`).

### S102: missing capability

- A body calls a capability its capability row does not list (`reject/missing-capability.ergo`, `missing-capability`).
- A callee needs a capability that no `with` provides (`reject/unprovided.ergo`, `unprovided-callee`).
- A provider expression of an inline wire needs a capability of its own wire (`probes/wire-sibling.ergo`) or one the enclosing function lacks (`probes/wire-initializer.ergo`).
- A named wire needs a capability from its caller: a named wire is closed (`probes/named-wire-requirement.ergo`; README Gap 6).
- `timeout.After` without `Scheduler`: `timeout.After` is an ordinary library function whose row lists `Scheduler` (`timeout-is-a-library-function`).
- An inferred capability reaches an exported function, which spells its row (`inferred-needs-reaches-exported`).

The checker does not restrict `main`'s capability row; the build refuses what the host cannot supply (README Gap 5).

### S103: not total

- A `catch` without `try` omits an error of the caught row (`reject/catch-not-total.ergo`, `catch-not-total`).
- A `match` over a union names neither every variant nor `case _` (`type-switch-not-total`).
- A multi-subject `match` leaves a tuple of variants unhandled; `_` matches any variant. Totality is decided by a usefulness check over the case matrix, never by enumerating the product (`product-not-total`). The message names one missing tuple.
- A `match` whose proof, or the resolution of its cases in the variant index, needs more than the fixed solver budget: "too many cases to prove this match total; split it or add case _", or, when the reachability of its cases needs more, "too many cases to prove which cases of this match are reachable; split it". The checker never accepts a match it has not proved. The solver is deterministic for a given source; reordering the subjects may change whether a switch near the budget is refused, never a proved verdict ([rows: totality](rows.md#totality) 5). A case of a union that lost a variant to a reported error adds no diagnostic of its own (D3). No missing-return diagnostic follows an S103 for the same switch (D3).

### S104: unknown name

- An unknown local, function, type, field, method, package or wire (`reject/unknown-name.ergo`, `unknown-local`, `unknown-type`, `unknown-field`, `unknown-selector`, `unknown-wire`).
- A Go built-in function other than `len`: `make`, `new`, `cap`, `copy`, `close`, `print`, `println`, `append`, `delete`, `min`, `max`, `clear`, `panic`, `recover`, `complex`, `real` and `imag` are not predeclared. The message names the Ergo form: `xs.Append(x)`, `m.Delete(k)`, a literal, `Console.Println`, `if a < b { a } else { b }` (#196, fourth round, item 2).
- A capability name in an expression position other than a method call's receiver, such as `f(Orders)` (`capability-as-value`; README Gap 29).
- A local of the same name as a capability that the function's written row lists, in the same frame (`local-and-binding-one-frame`; rows-and-constraints §7 amendment 3). A local in an inner frame may shadow a package capability.
- A capability row or a wire key names a type that is not a capability (`needs-non-capability`, `wire-entry-non-capability`).
- An error row names a type that is not a named struct type (`error-row-non-struct`).

### S105: unhandled failure

- A fallible call in a struct field value (`probes/composite-error.ergo`).
- A fallible `timeout.After` duration (`probes/fallible-duration.ergo`).
- A fallible expression as a `let` value, an expression statement, an operand, a selector receiver, a call argument, an `if` condition, a `match` subject or a `catch` arm value (`unhandled-define`, `unhandled-argument`, `unhandled-condition`).
- A call of an unexported helper whose inferred error row is not empty, in an exported function that does not handle it (`inferred-error-reaches-exported`).

### S106: bad provider

- A provider method's parameter types differ from the capability's (`probes/provider-parameter.ergo`).
- A provider without the capability's method, or whose method's error row is wider (`provider-missing-method`, `provider-wider-row`).
- A provider method that writes a capability row: its row is wider than the capability method's, which writes none (`provider-method-needs`; README Gap 17 stays with #37).

### S107: missing return

- A function or function literal with a result whose body can reach its end (`missing-return`). A body terminates as in Go's terminating statements: a final `return`, an `if` with an `else` whose branches terminate, a `for` without a condition or `break`, and a `match` that is total (names every variant or has `case _`) and whose cases all terminate.

### S108: type or declaration misuse

| Rule | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| A type, function, wire, method, field, parameter or local is declared twice in one scope; a type and a function share a name | `duplicate-function`, `probes/duplicate-field.ergo`, `duplicate-method`, `duplicate-parameter`, `probes/receiver-parameter.ergo` |
| A plain call `f(x)` of a name that several functions share; each takes a distinct named type of the package first and is called as `x.f(…)` (196m rule 3) | checker tests (`TestSelfCallSameNamedFunctions`) |
| A union variant is not a struct type declared in the package | `union-variant-interface` |
| A struct contains itself by value, also through an instance of a generic struct (`type U { F Wrap[U] }`), at any depth; one report per cycle | `recursive-struct`; checker domain tests (`TestFiniteChains`) |
| An instantiation cycle: a generic type or function instantiates itself, through any path, with an argument that grows (`type T[A] { F *T[[]A] }`, `func f[T]() { f[[]T]() }`), so its instances never end (Go's rule, `go/types` "instantiation cycle"), also through a method's receiver parameters and through any containing type, interface method signatures included; reported once, before rows are inferred | checker domain tests (`TestExpandingInstantiation`); the go/types differential test (`TestDifferentialGoTypes`, `FuzzDifferential`) |
| An initialization cycle: a package `var`'s initializer refers to itself through vars, functions or methods (Go's initialization order, `go/types` initorder). The cycle's vars become invalid, so no capability or error diagnostic follows from them | checker domain tests (`TestRowGraphDomain`) |
| A value of one type where another is expected: an assignment, an argument, a return, a field or an element | `var-mismatch`, `argument-mismatch`, `return-mismatch` |
| A type does not implement an interface, or its method's rows are wider (interface assignability) | `interface-missing-method`, `interface-wider-row` |
| A keyed literal omits a field that has no zero value; `let x T` of a type with no zero value | `keyed-literal-nondefaultable`, `var-nondefaultable` |
| A positional literal lists fewer values than the struct's fields | `positional-literal-short` |
| A struct field's value is a composite literal with no type, keyed or positional: "missing type in composite literal; write S{h: 1}" (`S{…}` past 40 characters or across a line; Go elides a type only for elements and map keys) ([types: structs](types.md#structs) 3) | checker tests (`TestMissingLiteralType`), classf `generic-elided-struct` |
| A type switch on a non-union; a case that is not a variant of its subject's union; a case already covered by the cases before it (unreachable) | `type-switch-non-union`, `case-not-variant` |
| An operator on operands it is not defined for; `==` on values that are not comparable; operands of two types, "mismatched types int32 and int64; write int64(a)", and two literals that took different defaults, "mismatched types int and float64; write 1.0 + 2.5" ([types: operators](types.md#operators) 2; 196u rule 4); a shift's left literal where a non-integer type is expected, "the left operand of a shift is an integer, and float64 is expected here; write int(1) << n, then convert the result" ([types: operators](types.md#operators) 3) | `equality-mismatch`, `plus-on-bool`; checker tests (`TestLiteralRules`, `TestNonConstantShift`) |
| A literal that cannot take its expected type (196u rule 1): "an integer literal is not a duration: write a duration literal such as 5s" (only a duration literal is a duration), "a float literal takes only a float type, not int; write 2", a rune literal outside the integer types, a string literal outside the string types; a name of another basic type, which never converts by itself (196u rule 3), "Limit is int; write int8(Limit) or declare Limit int8" ([types: basic types](types.md#basic-types) 6 and 7) | `integer-literal-as-duration`; checker tests (`TestLiteralRules`, `TestLiteralSites`) |
| A constant that overflows its type; an integer literal with a leading zero; an invalid escape; a duration that overflows `int64` nanoseconds. A typed `float32`, `float64`, `complex64` or `complex128` constant holds its type's rounded value, so `1/int(float32(16777217)-float32(16777216))` divides by zero | `constant-overflow`, `probes/decimal-leading-zero.ergo`, `probes/string-escape.ergo`, `probes/duration-overflow.ergo`; checker review tests (M12) |
| A constant index overflows `int`; a constant index, slice bound or `make` size is negative; a constant index or bound is out of range of an array or a constant string; constant slice bounds are out of order; a constant `make` length exceeds its capacity (Go's rules) | checker review tests (M11) |
| A constant key appears twice in a map literal, compared after conversion to the key type | checker review tests (N3) |
| `:=` declares no new name, or repeats a name on its left (reported once per name, and then no "no new names" follows); a name already declared in the block is assigned, not redeclared (Go's rule) | checker domain tests (`TestDefineTargetsDomain`) |
| `try` or `catch` on an expression that cannot fail; a caught type not in the row or caught twice | `try-infallible`, `catch-arm-not-in-row` |
| A type argument outside the inferred subset, reported at the call as "cannot infer T; write the type arguments, e.g. Fn[int](…)" with no other diagnostic ([types: generics](types.md) 6: a parameter only a constraint determines, a generic function as an argument, an inference from the expected result); literal arguments of one parameter with different defaults, "cannot infer T; write the type arguments, e.g. Two[int](…): its literal arguments take int and int32" (196u rule 6), and the same for a generic record literal (`Pair{1, 'a'}`); a typed argument, a function literal included, that does not unify with its parameter or conflicts with what an earlier argument inferred (`Two(x, y)` with `x` an interface and `y` a struct; Go's "does not match"); a generic function inside parentheses not instantiated there (`(Fn)[int]`); a constraint the argument does not satisfy, written, inferred or given by explicit instantiation `Id[int]`; a parameter used as a type and as a row; a function with implicit parameters used as a value without a call; a function used as a value inside its own recursive group whose body needs more than its unwritten row, directly or through a function literal, trailing block or go expression that is a value and calls f, reported at f's declaration as "f is used as a value at L:C inside its own recursive group; write its error row: func f(…) error[…]" (or "through the function literal at L:C", the trailing block or the go task that carries the use; or its capability row); an inferred row of a recursive component past the fixpoint's bound (2·(bodies + edges)·(distinct row elements + 1) checks), reported at the function as "cannot infer the error row of f; write it" ([rows](rows.md), Capability rows 6) | `type-argument-not-inferred`, `constraint-unsatisfied`, `parameter-kind-conflict` |
| `*T` outside a parameter or receiver type | `borrow-in-field` |
| A function value whose rows are wider than the function type's, such as a fallible function where an infallible type is expected | `fallible-function-value` |
| A wire literal outside `with` | `wire-literal-outside-with` |
| An interface or capability method writes a capability row | `interface-method-needs` |
| `return`, `break` or `continue` crosses a `with` block, a block argument or a bare block | `return-in-with-block` |
| An error type declares a method named `Error` | `error-method-on-error-type` |
| A named wire whose build can reach itself: a `with` of the wire in its providers, through a function, a method or a capability provider that enters it, or an embedding; entries of one named wire whose providers use each other's capabilities, so none can be built first | `wire-cycle`, `probes/cyclic-wire.ergo`, `probes/wire-method-cycle.ergo`; checker review tests (M14) |
| A machine's state or signal type is not a union; its initial value is not a value of the state type; its step is not a function from the state and signal types to `Decision[S, O]` | runtime.md, Machines and actors 1 |
| An argument or an operand has no value; a no-value function returns a value | `probes/void-argument.ergo`, `probes/void-fallible-return-value.ergo` |
| Others: a wrong argument or result count; a call of a non-function; a non-`bool` condition; a field set twice; an assignment to a package `var` (immutable) or to a non-addressable value, such as a field of a map element `m[k].f = v` (a map element itself is assignable, not addressable); a label defined twice; `break` or `continue` outside a loop, switch or select; `with` without a block; builtins called with the wrong arguments | the checker's messages |

### S109: owned by another ticket

The checker refuses a construct that another ticket owns, and names it, instead of checking it partly.

| Rule | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| A wire entry whose provider is a function (a constructor entry), such as `Orders: OpenOrders` | [#37](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/37), wire constructors (`wire-constructor-is-37`) |
| A wire header, `wire provides A, B { … }` or `wire needs C, D { … }` (#217) | [#196](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/196) stage b, the wire header ([rows.md](rows.md#wire) rule 8; README Gap 33; `wire-exposure-hides-entry`) |
| A `with` over a local value or over several wires, and a wire value outside `with`, `let w = wire { … }` | 196x, extern and wire values (check-v1) |
| A pattern after `let` or `for`: a record pattern, an `as` pattern or a literal (196p), or a tuple (196t); a tuple type or value (196t) | 196p and 196t, patterns and tuples (check-v1) |
| An `if` or `match` in value position | 196r, tail results (check-v1) |
| A defined type, `type Celsius float64` | 196p, type declarations (check-v1) |
| The `ordered` constraint; an `escaping` function type | 196g, constraints; 196e, escaping (check-v1) |
| A law, a `test` declaration, `assert` | 196l, laws and tests (check-v1) |
| `import task`, `scope`, `slice` or `queue` | lower-v1, the std modules |
| `import go net/url` | [#202](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/202), Go imports |
| A node or field the decided parser never builds, in a tree built by hand: a channel, `select`, `go`, `defer`, a label, `++` or `--`, a variadic parameter or spread argument, an array type with a length, a receiver, a dot or grouped import, a grouped `let`, a `:=` or multi-side assignment, an `if`, `for` or `match` header statement. The message is "… is not produced by the decided parser" | syntax `TestDecidedOnly` (no owner: the form left the language) |
| At build only: any refusal of the prototype bridge, checker or emitter, with the message "the prototype emitter cannot lower this program yet (#50): CODE message" at its position | [#50](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/50) |

### S110: unused

- A local is declared and never read (`unused-local`; `probes/same-local-as-cap.ergo`).
- An `as` binding is read in no case (`unused-type-switch-binding`).
- An expression statement is not a call, `try`, `catch` or `with` (`unused-expression`, `probes/unused-expression.ergo`).
- An import is not used (Go's rule).

*Prior art:* Go rejects unused locals, imports and unused expression values; Rust and Gleam warn instead. Ergo keeps Go's errors because its output is Go and because an unread value usually hides a dropped result.

### S111: duplicate wire entry

- A wire has two entries for one capability, and neither is a `replace` of an embedded entry (`duplicate-wire-entry`; README Gap 28).
- Two embedded wires bind one capability, and no `replace` entry of the embedding wire overrides it (rows.md, Wire 7).
- A wire whose embedding graph needs more than the package's fixed wire budget to check: "this wire's embedding graph is too large to check for duplicate entries; split it". The budget is 128 × (wire declarations and literals + entries + embeddings + capability names written in wire keys and `needs` rows + 1) steps of repeatable work (set nodes, union elements, probes against a summary, sorts), shared by every wire of the package and fixed by the source alone; each such step is charged before it runs, and the pass's single-pass reading of the wire source is at most 12 × the same size. The S111 is at the wire whose summary or body was being checked when the next step would pass the budget, or at each inline wire of the declarations of one name, and no other wire diagnostic follows from it. Neither the verdict nor the place of the S111 depends on the order of the declarations ([rows: wire](rows.md#wire) 5; checker tests `TestWireBudget`, `TestWireBudgetRefusal`, `TestWireBudgetPrefixes`, `TestWireBudgetOrder`).

*Prior art:* Google Wire rejects two providers of one type; Effect's `Layer.merge` keeps the last silently, which Ergo refuses. For the budget: TypeScript stops instantiation past a fixed count (TS2589), and rustc refuses past `recursion_limit` (default 128). For the order: Elixir's typer sorts definitions before its recursive traversal (module/types.ex).

### S112: resource map key

Designed: a map's key type must not be a resource in v0 ([resources: containers](resources.md#containers), README Gap 32). It is emitted when [#197](https://github.com/cevr/ergo/issues/197) implements resources.

### S113: entry and test functions

- `main` takes parameters (`main-parameter`) or type parameters.
- `main` returns a value; only an error row is allowed, as Go's `main` returns nothing (`main-value-result`; README Gap 4).
- `main` is called (`main-called`, `probes/main-call.ergo`); only the host calls it.
- `main` is used as a value, such as `run := main` or `call(main)`: a value would let ordinary code call it.

*Prior art:* Go's `func main()` takes nothing and returns nothing (Go still allows a call of `main`; Ergo refuses it, so the host is its only caller); Gleam's `main` takes no arguments.
